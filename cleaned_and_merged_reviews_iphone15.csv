60hz 1000 phone 2023 joke complete deal breaker
f16 pretty good

usbc lighting adaptor 29 usbc cable 29 align greenwashing apple make adaptor cheap ffs
wow boring
havent watched event yet call usbc port come proprietary name like 120hz
really limiting speed usb c base model pretty much reason much greed bet introduce 16 base model eu force
mad got rid product red color really disappointing year going buy garbage yellow green color iphone color peaked iphone 13 imo httpspreviewredditj9errqs9evnb1jpegwidth3920formatpjpgautowebps1b69cacdf8e21c8112b7450f00effe3c3e5dfab2
really like new color wish pro line half pigment
mother nature thing cringe af
iphone 15 iphone 14usbc
color miss prob saving sweet color pro
hz would considered 14 pro 15 14 heavy
anyone know thinner bezel noticeable pro regular one desperately need know please
nice addition enough upgrade 14 pro ill wait see next year
im pretty interested adding metal upscaling putting game like village iphonevery awesome
13pro honestly 15pro doesnt offer enough feature justify ill happy base 15 maybe 15 plus pack enough feature justify change
14 usb c port
really didnt mind lightning port havent syncd data wire phone 5 year held lot abuse let hope usbc port robust crappy like hp laptop nice new standard soon android decides find something better apple behind though
country finland price follows 15 128gb 989 1062usd 15 256gb 1119 1200usd 15 512gb 1369 1470usd 15 plus 128gb 1139 1223usd 15 plus 256gb 1269 1362usd 15 plus 512gb 1519 1630usd 15 pro 128gb 1249 1340usd 15 pro 256gb 1379 1480usd 15 pro 512gb 1629 1749usd 15 pro 1tb 1879 2017usd 15 pro max 256gb 1499 1609usd 15 pro max 512gb 1749 1877usd 15 pro max 1tb 1999 2146usd
thought id hate green colour like still wish white option
spoiler alert nothing new
even surprised announced usb c regular capability pro model like innovation rumor regular model 20 usb speed true
watched hoping
meh year nothing overly new innovated incremental improvement
dynamic island nice color suck im kind bummed cuz planning buy one next year price drop
model oled dynamic island without oled level display may look wonky
gf waiting upgrade phone impact iphone 13 14 price shes looking spend 700 new phone doesnt need new fancy anything preferably though shed wide camera angle advice
yep well thats defintely new iphone first got bigger number thats sure
alone thinking default size notch would smaller reason assumed incorporating dynamic island feature could bring front camera element closer together without looking odd imbalanced pixel single punchout notch front camera sure thought assumed core component would take le space newer model
anyone hear anything dolby atmos dts
iphone 15 rated battery life iphone 15 yeah see
boooring plus still apple watch ipad compatibility even though interface would already support
pink pro pro always boring color
least enticing yeartoyear upgrade remember ill sick 14 pro
im using iphone 11 far nothing apple announced made wan na upgrade time really upgrade contract run battery degraded point annoying like usb c great thing finally thats thing apple far year a17 chip able run console pc game handle ray tracing seems extremely good
60hz refresh irks give u 90hz base model pro get 120hz dont care dont want buy pro refresh rate
dont need new iphone pink awesome
putting av1 decoder behind pro model mean av1 adoption continue lag phone people buy cant decode understand like usb2 speed case reusing a17 uhhhhh see a17 bit quickly outdated generation needed move away asap
need ask people immersed iphones dynamic island actually cool look like frankly quite huge waste space shape black oval phone screen info display literally go anywhere else dropdown menu even status bar top
little confused keynote mention youll soon able charge apple watch airpods iphone
running 13 pro see little reason upgrade year especially price everything skyrocketing wait another year two
dont think interest upgrading iphone near future fooling public little advancement tech play marketing sell
yay maybe dynamic island get devs stuff
yes every news outlet let u know
deleted
another year normal iphone let going try iphone android counterpart always advanced goddamn apple 60hz screen really amount money
14 color kinda ugly imo excluding usual black

base iphone new se
lmao get usbc still speed lighthing lmao cant obvious change port law make still get stuck shit speed gg apple gg
apple officially transitioned usbc phone airpods promax going forward probably product well yay however regular iphone 15 support usb 20 480 mbit 31 10 gbit like pro think thats quite disappointing dont see reason limitation seems rather artificial really get people buy pro mean talking 20 year old standard 20 30 specified 15 year ago premium phone like iphone sell premium price 1000 id expected least 30 think justified stupid clear think 15 great phone also little disappointing finally usbc limitation 20 guess charging speed also little disappointing thats necessarily 2031issue
really bored upgrade cycle 12 cant hold battery anymore really poor shape colour available year really bland wheres product red accessory
say anything always display base model
feel like weakest sale pitch jumping pro model ever
pro pro max always ugly compared normal plus want pink sooooo bad refuse downgrade camera pay
usb4 thing apple chooses use usb2 lol ok
man color surely let
red edition year
idk everyone complaining underwhelming keynote yes weve reached point plateauing phone thats ok dont need upgrade every year 2 year even 3 year io update interesting honestly always interesting imo iterative update hardware perfectly fine gf example iphone 8 going upgrading 15 massive upgrade imagine coming phone
meh disappointment innovation eu forcing apple use standard port event sucked big time
u2 taken lol
wonder iphone precision finding apple watch limited series 9 u2 watch old series 6 u1 u1 chip work fine iphones locating airpods pro 2 really anything u1 apple watch used feature support kept newer version

rtechnicallythetruth
technically correct isnt
also portrait mode also automatically enabled automatically shooting
plane plane saying plane plane ryan george
1 iphone 1 iphone
back glass colorful instead clear time subtle judging photo video really beautiful effect
crowd go mild consume take 25k please
usb 3 speed headline feature pro model yeah id guess standard 15 still communicates usb2 speed
really matter havent transferred anything phone via cable year
let see understand thistheyve put fastest cpu gpu ever seen mobile phone 3nm groundbreaking lithography process create cpu 2023 cant even enable 40gbps usbc 3 year old least ill take bet next year iphone 16 20gbps followed iphone range 20gbps iphone 18 40gbps samsung introduces 2024
yeah pro come usb 2 cable since dont even seem sell usb 3 cable iphone 15 pro spec page footnote near usb speed say usb 3 cable required hilarious
god ridiculous apple way
bit childish apple limit speed 480 mbps even lowly ipad mini 500 5 gbps silicon a16 already support higher speed
thought someone said arent allowed per eu law unless mean iphone 16 make usb3 theyre one year
many regular iphone user even use cable transfer data nowadays probably literally 3 im exaggerating course far important get high data speed pro max
im gon na throw
30 32 say official apple site
12 mini gang
unless create smaller footprint phone im keeping mini
brought pro feature base model year although thats really thing year
basically want fully adopted worth development time apps support fragment user use long term
trickle technology
side grade personally hate ugly gaping hole screen certain apps like map screen around hole blurred mean le usable screen notch version
theyre gearing underscreen camera pro year
announce new feature dynamic island curious theyre adopting signature iphone quirk
would prefered 120hz 13 pro notch compared 60hz dynamic isle
im honestly bit surprised guess want make island core part design better bringing sooner rather later
dealbreaker ill never buy anything botched forced screen art watch movie device im working around annoyance guess se soldier
besides reiterating super retina xdr display didnt mention higher refresh rate anything still 60hz 2023
yep look like ill buying refurbished 13 pro 680 replace iphone 8
yes
regular pro
made one easy look like im waiting till next round
feel 12pm know wrong post also 15pm feel different
se2 dont see reason upgrade kind getting sad put le innovative iphone day
im stuck iphone 12 mini waiting form factor hoping itll se usbc dont want forced larger phone
yeah bit sad dont even want 60hz want variable rate go 10hz swear notice difference eye strain
90hz would fitting mediumlevel upgrade go along w usbc
extra hz really make difference
99 people cant tell difference happening
guess
pro version phone 120hz ability play console game pretty decent although expensive course
look boring
didnt hear theyve year
part apple year
someone explain specifically clearly think happening forced eu regulation effect could make another phone lightning wanted theyre making change committed using lightning 10 year ended year many dipshit antiapple narrative crumble slightest scrutiny like literally objectively forced right yet yall endlessly repeat
apple would ready ruling didnt start designing iphone 15 day 14 announced
keeping speed cant get spoiled shit
beside political beef hows typec bringing anything new table
watched different presentation take one taking place mind
yea got good laugh
dont need ship cable anymore
even airpods bought mine fuck
data transfer feed faster ever using 10 year old technology youre welcome
100 agree standard version seem better deal
really still 60hz
new chip though
absolutely correct
fair iphones go couple release slightly iterative look back generation true 1 3g 3gs 4 4 55c 5 se 6 6 78 se2 x11 1215
new paint car come air freshener voila sadly people line common sense logic trait teachable
need one get rid lightning cable
dont really see iphone 15 cooler though underwhelming keynote ever 15 basically iphone 14 dynamic island usbc
thats basically iphone x onwards
carbon neutral
midnight gone thankfully
early would announced wwdc iphone event
wasnt expecting kind chatgpt level ai honest llm got big year way early development apple implement thing user experience chatgpt still beta think within year 2025 best case scenario see llm utilised capacity io
new processor mean new absolute sense a16 new nonpro model
120hz screen
vast majority user arent going care usb 2 transfer speed base model going plug charging data sync wirelessly faster transfer speed matter pro workflow
said usbc would 30 speed 30 cable 15 pro
new design rounded edge matte back glass
regarding chip appletsmc capacity number 3nm chip produce newest chip exclusive pro make sense non anti consumer way realistically couldnt handle production many new chip non pro model everything else luxury feature imo wouldnt affect use phone least except button wtf
cringe worthy
oh man amount fart sniffing segment
literal slave labor make iphones see environmentally friendly
weather coming
fucking woke segment
might first non pro since x
60hz tho rather buy text block draw frame
matte pastel green pink pretty
honest comment agree completely impressive update 15 series pro
battery better pro compared standard 15
yes pro phone arent good value one best value money year
great phone
yeah
color washed especially green blue wish brought back blue 12
blue people wanted white
like deliberately made ugly people would opt pro version
pastel day im getting iphone 6 vibe year
likey
kind blue mile davis
maybe 5 year raise 90hz
recently made change girlfriend wfh set due software glitch one monitor maxing 30hz 60 sitting directly next monitor running 120hz even pointed move mouse around screen glaringly apparent yet cant even tell difference represents 99 user phone
customer want standard iphone experience doesnt care refresh rate apple know customer looking higher refresh rate automatically migrate pro model
60hz usb 2 800
tbh 1 reason upgrade pro apple know theyre
like cat going outside youve never experienced dont care
ive tried android apple device 120hz refresh rate worth battery hit even small ive never disappointed 60hz panel iphone use
usb 2 speed
60hz fine phone lol
literally dont care 120hz 60 look fine 30hz id pissed 60 fine eye
seriously world graphing calculator 120 hz iphone 60
thought dynamic island needed promotion fluid
care
touch sensor still 120hz care
might feel embarrassed cant tell difference
really doesnt matter much mobile device
pro mobile gamer
need higher refresh rate
60hz dealbreaker dont buy phone go one offer 120hz suspect people looking get iphone display refresh top priority
first 800 phone released since last year apple event 60hz display know love
swear god never noticed difference ipad pro phone got promotion guess need see old phone v 14pro see notice never looked phone thought looked smoother whatever
bro doesnt understand company work
get 120hz 300 android phone really wished theyd brought 90hz non pro model
2023 still usb 20 transfer speed nonpro model well ridiculous
compared spec 15 pro 13 pro better chip beyond barely change camera pretty much everything
yup httpspreviewreddit7ipebbyk5vnb1jpegwidth1024formatpjpgautowebps5f8b9ef6655785a0a4580a9c62ef800bf2579f42
yeah feel like iphones 7 solid upgrade year x biggest change since fairly marginal term design major feature guess broken dont fix
camera take pick
huge bump
technically accurate 2018 ipad pro usbc first macbook 2014
mean yes get usbc hot topic comment actually getting insane
macbook like 2012 still run one usbc
mean fair lightning us usb
opened whole thing saying iphone 15 new design
stupid statement paired usb2 speed nonpro model biggest joke year keynote
funny sad presenter bunch snake
red reason buy
new watch come product red variant tbf
couldnt agree youre harping material colour much youre idea
wonder virtual audience would applaud lackluster innovation
green screen
got say prefer recorded version theyre slicker run faster focussed also get wider diversity people presenting youve got imagine small amount people apple handle pressure presenting gig like english thus emotionally repressed ive always cringed cheering clapping whooping apple pre covid event embarrassing especially see journalist crowd thanks loving post 2020 format
keynote havent live since covid
care photography price right 14pro might better deal downside lightning cable v usbc otherwise 14pro superior every way id wait price drop first though
15 14pro minus promotion screen probably upgrade wife x 15 already screen batery change performance gone lot doesnt need pro feature base model enough
weird could done year ago also weird mac apple first go usb c even point ridiculed many think didnt want lose mfi money lightening also slight technical advantage port design since little male piece inside female end port increase potential breakage
mo make everything sound innovative even though feature theyre bragging done android year
new colour process
dont think ill upgrade release another purple one like iphone 11 unfortunately lost mine six flag white 11
announced
best color besides boring black
99 iphone owner wont notice care
apple master gatekeeping pricing
always 120hz variable refresh rate display a17 pro processor better battery life usb c usb 3 10gbps lidar scanner
120hz screen
anymore updated processor camera
could take samsungs like please take samsungs
theory apple purposely including many android feature device added small amount mean wont run new feature seems like many android phone running new feature implement
feel basic yes pretty much sum entire apple upsell model
threw pro model promotion 120 hz
hey theyre trying save planet
airpods also still charge lightning cable id keep around anyway im upgrading year
circulating around web see believe mentality
remember correctly law usbc passed october 2022 still kinda unsure
rumor around
agree
13 pro really wouldve loved 15 mini
im hoping mini becomes new se next year
also 30
trying figure launch old apple product option putting cart 15 dont see option except purchasing starting apple upgrade program im already upgrade program keeping old phone happen know buy apple card full purchase spread payment option payment option noted correctly actually sale
face id really good better alternative us pinhole camera also occupying part screen nothing happening 99 time smart ui compromise
im market 800 watched presentation finde abt usbc stuff would want high fps phone
thats nut s23 400 think 120hz
man galaxy a53 5g 120 hz iphone mine isnt even samsungs flagship series
yep agreed deal breaker would pre order pink iphone 15 friday 120hz display think get used 13 pro instead literally want phone 1 io 2 120hz display
right dont give two crap better camera pro wanted normal iphone 120hz display look like ill waiting iphone 20 point
every year push towards samsung
800
think number mixed 1000 usd 15pro 120hz 200 pro max
finally decide theyll make sound innovative like something thats never done
xiaomi 11t pro mine 120hz looking apple cant see benefit
important note smaller sensor compared 14 pro 15 pro 2u v 24u mean little bit worse despite faster apeture also apple proraw either think best new super resolution 48mp jpegs heavily processed
15 got better main camera lens 15 pro
mean
pro
beauty usc cable dirt cheap anywhere
would include cable cut support year ago reduce ewaste cost adapter number adapter produced go unused thrown away
theyre releasing huge slew phone different color every year greenwashing strong
normally connector end cost money wire cheap adapter short cable
called usbc fancy name
cant wait new revolutionary dynamic port pro
lightningc port
android phone 20 well cant lock speed unless use cable putting slower standard isnt banned unfortunately
defend choice cant remember last time transferred anything via wire seems like complete nonissue
eu reason care goal directive reduce ewaste unifying cabling charger

z fold break within 1 year enjoy year
wait pro pro max white option
absolutely complete trash point
15 23 apple doesnt use ultra model naming understand wrong
argue telephoto setup actually work 3x portrait useful longer since fixed 5x zoom 5x rarely useful even national park rarely would situation 10x framed photo well
pricing went 50 euro base model 100 pro model httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphone15promaxpricingusindiagermanyuknews59877php
magsafe charger
charge quite fine listening music bluetooth headphone
2023 get wireless charger
serious question
usb usb c cable around like 10 year ask android mate probably spare give one old phone
apple probably overpriced many third party option job
shitty usb 20 port nonpro 15
eu specifically mentioned said regulation illegal using usb c dont proof doubt although regular iphone 15 usb 20 besides compatibility much better lightning guess usb 30 expensive 799 phone
wont restriction compatibility 3rd party usbc cable
born without face strange thing say
doesnt look like thats card
120hz resolution refresh rate
every year need pretend youre expert
fwiw apple stock always tank keynote day retail trader pile expecting pump
usb 2 going enough bandwidth
want get rid physical button always war physical button eventually button replaced soft button
20w 27w normal
14 pro stop produced get soon
phone 12 mp camera year apple recent flagship main shooter
apple thread talking huawei lol people desperate attention
15 plus
weird
wobbly
ive like dozen android phone usb c never happen lg samsung google oneplus etc ever thought consider handling phone poorly beating port arent indestructible
honestly think got dumber reading comment
moment thought asking upgrade phone wife decision decision
friday
128gb 256 512
dont want dissuade whatever knowing home situation past year rising trend theft transit get empty iphone box happened back upgrading google fi service pixel 4 samsung s22 got empty box took 15 month round round fedex google eventually get google ship 2nd phone telling im paying 1000 empty box know imei etc information stolen phone able track ended california somewhere colorado pretty clear wasnt thief think im purchase store
id totally get battery replaced wait next year
technically 15 pro year version sony sensor main lens practice able tell difference ultrawide remains 1910

lol
downvoting youre getting help show fucked planet infinitely blindly consuming new phone new tech every year complete insanity especially change minimal im saying im get new phone every 35 year mbp many people downvoting lame buy capatilistic sheep new phone help get laid spread gene haha
usb 3 speed headline feature pro model jesus lol
usb 3 speed headline feature pro model yeah id guess standard 15 still communicates usb2 speed im using connector charging speed irrelevant sure higher power delivery usb 3 might nice motivating factor
unit price difference 10 gigabit 1 gigabit port still significant 20 32 pro feature unfortunately eta example bad based gigabit ethernet v 10 gb ethernet consumer device router laptop still using 1gb cheapest 10gb router could find amazon 500 recently m2 mac studio mini got 10gb ethernet m1 imac using 1gb
asking hoping im asking someone help would person care one way another data speed usb connection basically relevant transferring photovideo computer cant imagine normal user would need speed help
eu regulation
higher speed port cost like 20 cent
reason besides making 15 pro look better making pro feature
wan na transfer 200 gig video macbook look speed comparison
thats apple never let really use storage
even 480mbit way faster think transferring photo music thats critical need done twenty second
heard could plug gopro edit photo photo
today took good
pretty much main reason havent considered getting iphoneyet people say 8k recording megapixels useless social medium stuff many people record life family child growing able moving file connecting thunderbolt ssd straight phone huge
yes amount iphone user care higher transfer speed usb 2 statistically negligible best absolutely useless feature overwhelming majority people
got credible source supporting claim afaik s23 ultra usb 32 gen 1 cap 5 gig
eu legislation address charging specifically usb pd nothing data transfer
eu say cant restrict speed however port used usb2 restricting speed restricting speed using usb30 port making run usb20 speed
also eu law hasnt even taken effect yet iphone 17 first iphone subject new eu law
james valtteri
usb 32 gen 2 usbs confusing name structure usb 3 blame 15 pro usb 3 10 gigabit link usb 31 gen 1 usb 32 gen 1 usb 30 would mean 5 gigabit speed
like dead battery gang
120hz display right
honestly idea
120hz arguably best thing could bring
wheres lidar
make ton sense
thats probably developer would take advantage standardized across model
oof
holding 13 another year guess
model pro 60 hz well
regular still 60
man im waiting someone say iphone 7 feel different
12 pro even playing friend 14 pro feel like big leap
12pm upgraded 13pm refresh rate
feel way 12pm still performing flawlessly ive got choice make get 15pm year paid job wait year like originally wanted large chance job pay new phone due company change horizon think choice clear even dont feel like time yet
pro variable refresh rate dont think heard speak
100 head lol visible measurable difference still image displayed 60hz 10hz refresh rate matter
60 90 absolutely 90 120 personally much
completely change experience honest doubt anyone 90hz android phone would enjoy going 60hz apple machine
make massive difference tight money last year sold iphone 500 bought cheap 200 samsung 120hz display feel much better smoother using 60hz phone feel like aid never go back 60hz
make difference think pcconsole gaming scenario doesnt really matter much smartphone ive using used budget android phone nokia g400 mess around see ui feel fidget customization device definitely see feel smoothness responsiveness going back main phone iphone xr easily live trade classify high refresh rate mobile device nice rather thats take would imagine large chunk iphone user like really use consumption device high refresh rate cool needed
yes notice ipad pro
absolutely make phone feel much faster premium
yes need imessage rcs open plz europe
thank european union big difference aint excluding certain country fact many citizen antieu deem ineffective reality theyve managed force biggest tech company world knee hater
extended laptop 2026
youre welcome hope love cooky youve collected throughout year
wait new standard thats much better usb c come need wait selfinterested touch bureaucrat allow apple adopt whole precedent absurd terrible innovation efficiency
yes excited iphone airpods apple watch require different charger
yeah wont ship cable anymore us standard one
mac usb ipads
remember everyone pitching fit macbook air usb c port lol
tbf think apple laptop iirc first close first put usb computer maybe first usb besides firewire
mean everywhere except phone apple essentially leading pack usbc basically true stupid took long bring iphone
yes thats good apple moving way anyway like get eu angle people really think apple going stay lightning forever almost product moved
people also forget magsafe thing three year relevant magsafe option make transition usbc le painful relying magsafe charge phone need change cable right away also magsafe incentivized accessory maker rely much lightning port transition le painful well im convinced introduced magsafe apple already planning switch usbc
well nobody unless willing violate nda apple pretty obvious didnt want lightning stick around anyone else remember lighting ipad pro exactly 1 year saw writing wall year ago basically relegated lightning low power device made everything else usbc
apple something good like limiting packaging material reduce waste redditor responds saying make money way environment apple come california favor right repair legislation must lobbied ruined legislation apple evil apple switch usbc like reddit wanted eu forced big fan tesla cant imagine obsessing every thing like antiapple redditors
think ipads moved mac moved iphones didnt try cope say 10 year commitment ask better apple committed port phone 5 year far better alternative
going take effect next year
apple often say already planning something judge regulator forced mosthilariously south korea compelled allow thirdparty payment provider app store turned around said lol time said would comply eu regulation
true trivial factor port ass europe want
issa joke
god fanboys number today
better theyre iphone 13
yup make buy apple notion 120hz somehow pro company stupid hoping could upgrade 13 pro normal 15 id rather keep 120hz get stupid dynamic island gimmick
7 id argue redesign performance increase gen gen packed waaay wallop since 7 thing definitely cooled exception maybe x
iphone x x 11pro 15 pro massive change going curved blocky side
mate 15 pro look 20x better 12 pro
think person youre replying agrees read several time yeah 12 mini dying thats reason im upgrading
lol literally save planet purchase new iphones talk win win
yknow whats better environment keep current phone likely youre fairly new anyway
well dont use case itll look good without
use rebel flex doesnt cover side like way look dont seeing fingerprint everywhere
would accepted even alexa level ai instead siri found web
free version chatgpt already outdated tech gpt4 real deal apple easily able get something level gpt3
apparently new autocomplete ios17 based gpt algorithm theyre already starting
llm got big year way early development apple implement thing user experience already implemented throughout microsoft ecosystem
yeah got wrong realized 14 a15 a16
omehow peedy creen couldnt make thi year
surprising apple certainly care transfer speedas user penny pinching cool one
course sort teeth grinding fact apple chooses create artificial product tier usb 2 ancient product shipping apple pricing ladder
yes pro get usb 3 least 10 gig though
new feature talk fill time slot something
1010 cringeometer
wouldnt able go back 60hz screen youre 120 really start feel difference
agree would nice swear yall sound crazy talking
least pro good blue
noticed really like blue 13 12
oh yes love 12 pro blue blue color 15 nonpro look horrible tbh 15 pro blue look okay doesnt sell 12 pro blue perfect maybe going back black sigh
want 5c color
easter color
something tell went pastel color palette showed new colored glass best
kinda get feeling havent given regular iphones 90 hz yet never theyll probably give regular iphones 120 hz display pro get 180240 hz
yup whenever get excited new monitor push 144hz partner cant tell cant tell 60hz 120hz sometimes tell 30hz 60 tell 24hz 30hz u nerd ob thing fine doesnt matter large majority one love 120hz iphone ipad feel like one thing notice hard go back
bingo
thats crazy lol wife tech savvy notice something different 13 pro screen said appeared faster
compared iphone 13 pro regular one side side really concentrate tell difference
hertz dont
youre absolutely right people tell difference dad one people literally tell difference 60hz 120hz
lol dont even know mean guess im target audience lol
really cant tell switching 60hz 144hz monitor switched 144hz monitor year stuck 60hz monitor didnt notice big difference sure slightly smoother nothing crazy really notice go 144 hz back 60hz scrolling 60hz phone feel terrible since made switch 120hz display phone
mostly depends screen didnt realize set pc monitor 60hz jumped fps game general desktop usage didnt notice mouse moving smoothly switched back 144hz could tell difference desktop cursor looking
thats refresh rate work though really wont see difference 60 120 click 60 feel incredibly slow 30 even worse litteraly cant play game 30 feel like slow motion
similar thing happened dad recently used computer horror found monitor 4k 30hz cheap one hdmi port didnt support new hdmi standard didnt know wouldnt felt like crap maybe diidnt know articulate
geek going complain forever youre correct people want use phone throughout day dont care refresh rate
99 people look like mention kind spec lol
bro could literally say feature major iphone customer one buy shit imessage used
count dont care refresh rate group
suck excuse
man say pretty much feature put iphone average customer doesnt care insane performance bionic engine camera year take slightly better photo low light yet keep adding thing consumer would probably still notice difference 60fps 120fps though like notice change supposedly dont care might understand exactly one device feel smoother thats sort thing apple sell reason base iphone still 60hz major selling feature get people buy pro simple
standard iphone experience device thats smooth operating higher refresh rate contribute smoothness
customer want standard iphone experience doesnt care choice refresh rate ftfy cant claim someone doesnt want something getting offered something
well yeah competition baseline phone offer better
yeah bet percentage people iphone even know refresh rate surprisingly low
true like come least give u 90hz
wife smart iphone 13 guarantee doesnt even know term refresh rate mean something care
customer feel phone faster higher refresh rate guaranteed theyre cutting corner maximize profit dont say customer driven lol
midrange android 120hz half price really excuse put 120hz 15 make noticeable difference smooth snappy phone feel
average consumer doesnt care also dont care retina display oled display taptic engine powerful cpu hundred feature dont care solid logic
refresh rate noticeable aspect phone especially someone gotten used higher rate cant go back thered good portion people pro feature care
b step model make cheaper one worse purpose pro better screen pretty good way separate also blind person cant immediately tell 120hz look better
true standard iphone customer would definitely care 120hz 70 feature mentioned today
logic
geek thrifty
friend got iphone 13 pro max asked thought 120hz pro motion looked like two head showed difference 60 120 told didnt see difference cant tell trolling didnt care asked got 13 pro max said larger size offered iphone 14 launch show people dont care refresh rate
customer want standard iphone experience doesnt care refresh rate apple know customer looking higher refresh rate automatically migrate pro model absolutely im programmer gamer work gaming laptop 144hz display yet im happy basic iphone se latest version io home button touch id 5g connectivity a15 chip 430 unlocked without carrier contract lockin im professional photographer take many photosvideos anyway camera work fine need lastly roughly 16gb free 64gb includes photo video took last 8 year recent podcasts tv show couple movie whatever people sent messaging application refresh a16a17 implement usbc 23 year ill probably consider upgrading im happy
dont care dont know better never get experience feedback loop
agree fence pro model phone feature want 15 kicker refresh rate disappointing
actually going make migrate iphone se 4 eventually come assuming oled screen like one way street pro model im getting barely premium feature 800 might well drop pay least amount possible better camera 10 faster cpu
use high refresh rate screen laptop phone whatever care cant go back 2023 give higher refresh rate base model even cheap android minimum 90hz display day
apple premium brand stepping deliver premium experience regardless think customer care tradeoff vrr 120hz capable screen
fixed apple know sell whatever 800 price point single premium feature
feel cheap leave feature budget android phone 2019 800
hooray anticonsumer behavior
120hz phone option switch 60hz really care extra battery life though im sure much difference even make anyone run test document difference
phone 120hz let toggle 60hz optionally via battery saving mode phone battery last well day regardless 120hz would positive
usb2 speed 800 phone 2023 hilarious wireless file transfer probably faster good network
iphone 15 us last year a16 bionic soc doesnt circuitry usb 3 speed dont think average iphone user transfer data wired connection often anymore reality people wont really care notice people really need want faster usb 3 speed get iphone 15 pro hopefully next year iphone 16 get year a17 pro chip circuitry faster speed
price
800 phone
experience 120hz hard go back ill hanging onto 13 pro pry cold dead hand longer io support lol
970 price tag aint fine though lol seriously many android phone half market rocking 120hz display keep defending apple like ok ask premium price yet deliver premium quality
60 hz 800 dollar phone lol
certain many people care battery life promotion increase throttle refresh rate timethings people phone isare static screen frame increase battery
graphing calculator doesnt gps modem graphic card 17 significantly harder thing thing really think point
one nerd
wonder usb 2 speed pro version feature grid specifically mention usb3
ok making sure stream isnt like 2 minute behind
probably go 2 year cycle version
best way make money apple longer focusing innovation stability thats sell
steve job great disservice humanity passing away soon
wait camera normal one pro
accurate since various apple product usbc year isnt 12inch macbook 2015
2012
apple one first computer manufacturer add usbc laptop fact heavily criticized came macbook air usbc one using back basically required dongle useful people people act like apple never usbc device ironic
stupid technically accurate
red probably come march event
also spent way much time environmental stuff listen im sustainable practice mention talk effort maybe minute move made whole skit
im sure thats large reason way isnt person event generate much hype virtual keynote
color muted wonder theyre perfecting process get red
care especially mother 2021 samsung a32 feel faster iphone 11 feel faster iphone 15 x200b apple greed
thats point people migrating android 10000 notice care lol say 99 iphone owner havent ever gotten pro model past phone shouldve atleast used 90hz display
asked iphone user 999999 say care
youre wrong 120hz one main selling point pro without bet siginificantly higher would chose base model lower profit margin pro greedy marketing torturing exaggerating base model user 60hz get switch pro
also 3x 5x telephoto titanium rail sturdy
sweet
honestly really care screen looked great ever since switched amoled whatever called
like
ill upgrade iphone airpods die toss lightning cable away
didnt say wasnt clever maybe useful said marketing wonder fact named named dynamic island invokes many thing clever way show notification amazing keep mentioning everywhere forefront actual big feature
budget android phone 90hz year excuse apple using
wouldnt interact incredibly often feel nice
extremely smooth next time walk phone store use one phone display 120hz screen get used 120hz phone using day going back 60hz feel like trash
budget phone 2019 90hz
beware heavy weight far unpleasant iphone experience damn uncomfortable hold behemoth hand could reconsider id hold whatever year two run option slap 120hz regular iphones
mentality stupid matter much buy damn pro
many year considered empty threat
fun
youre
sure yet youre still using iphone right
800 u said euro expensive europe
wait find place outside u
without tax luxury evading tax like apple
sale tax basically 1000
lol stupid comment
bro said
europe fact exist
120hz make huge difference everyday use scrolling home gesture look much better 120hz besides ive used 120hz monitor since 2012 phone since 2020 60hz meh
aperture bigger base 15 f16 v f178 sure better
price waste apple charge adapter new cable effectively telling user throw old cable landfill instead reusing messaging wildly inconsistent
talking availability store whats included ton lightning cable would nice get adapter reasonable price instead new cable toss old one
unit economics spent half keynote touting green sensibility pricing like make absolute joke
probably patented
apple vision port c
issue tell little think costumer cost proper usb c 32 port negligible
coral abide rubicon
agree 12 blue deep rich rank 13 series higher tho product red better 12 series
mean think unreasonable u want apple offer 45 different color across 17 different size configuration iphone every single year
underwhelming color standard model definitely upselling strategy point least cancelling white one
get offended corporation behalf lmao
let u miserable peace
apple enthusiast already assume sadist
remember came black started offering white people lost crap
color look like light pastel
want hot barbie pink
im one lol want pink pro thought barbie trend would make lame neutral pro
could literally offer colour phone
yeah hate associate color ffs
thats true
thank 333
meh ok remember bought 13pro noticed screen moved faster hd somehow boyfriend base 13 ok worth 200usd difference
dont fall hype 120 hz literally take 45 min get used either direction
want one fucking charging cable work across vast majority device macbook charge usbc ipad usbc iphone lightning airpods lightning give one universal charger find something different complain
think mixing usb micro usb c usb c connect way well
yeah everything else usb c pain dick 2nd cable one device throwing 65w laptop charger bag confident charge thing great keeping 2 cable car sure first world problem apple literal last holdout everyone else got program
say lightning doesnt care way go like usbc doesnt well plus even better usbc usbc cable plug either end phone
fuck lightning cable
ill admit though apple usb connection imacs feel way secure manufacturer laptop satisfying click meanwhile lenovo dell laptop usb c connection loose doesnt inspire confidence expect iphone
someone kid lightning connector durable
usbc plus standardizing cable need carry around airpods watch dedicated cord share least never really issue lightning happy one le cable travel
havent stress tested new port group 8 year old yet may trouble see louis rossman say youtube
make sense faster better
yeah honestly bit disappointing
like people dont understand technology ever care thats fine let deal slower technology dont know better used got used faster tech im sure would appreciate typical apple selling phone 2023 spec 2008
wont apple insult people intelligence every year event openly fazed anymore annoying
thats nice hear defs upgrading base 15 se2020 value proposition seems decent aside 120hz
checked th 14 pro apple website look like completely discontinued maybe get new one store 13 pro maybe best buy carry something le wondering thats step major way
may well never get excited anything since chance someone else first
still took worse photo dont get started video
pretty sure s23 ultra new 208mp camera apple still take great photo dont get wrong acting like revolutionary dumb
could concern customer mom need new phone telling 15 shes leaning towards 14 mostly avoid buying new cable
dont plan upgrading 14 absolutely 14 6 sometimes still think 6ssuch great phone
wont go time obviously think still one oldstyle charger cable around somewhere
thats cant wait
riiiiiiight pile bad lightning cable bad contact office mt everest compared bad usbc one still using original usbc cable ipads
poor thing
want since device use would make easier one cable also would make lightning cable useless feel like waste
theyre pissed apple didnt design want complain
want usbc cabels full time android user im going switch iphone 15 test io long usbc still use one cabel device dont need take second cable
iphones shipped usbc lightning cable 4 year
id hope nobody would happy le id say
ok apple sheep calm
nothing wrong eye theyre sensitive wan na read people experience httpsforumsmacrumorscomthreadsanyonewithpwmissuesgettingtheiphone132312292httpsforumsmacrumorscomthreadsanyonewithpwmissuesgettingtheiphone132312292 affect 10 population
see comparison bye bye iphone x hello 15 pro max
experience worst kept iphone 14
usually change phone every year thats non issue
yes going picture showcased event upon looking site look way better color
im saying samsung s23 ultra lot better money new iphone
bluetooth headphone yuck thanks
rather boomer pay le worse
ah yes wireless charger need plug socket wire first
may compatible carplay believe need official cable work
work place dont allow face id building security reason iphone user unlock pin
pro model usb 32
software button horrible
thats disappointing hoping would go faster charging
really apple clever
wait another year probably
still remember working apple store time old lady first line yelling get gay shit phone laughed directed website half u gay album cover wasnt even gay reference

im x guy looking upgrade
last bit cant projecting hang ups lol
thankfully usb charging disconnected data rate
look like controller built a17 chip reused last year chip regular iphone
worse gigabit usb 20 maximum theoretical speed 480mbps realistically usually get half much best
thousand dollar phone cant convince significant
lol pro feature nearly every mid high end android phone
silicon a16 support far higher speed see ipads
arbitrarily pro feature
pretty much got useful transferring file locally whether making local backup still good idea copying photo etc
usb 20 acceptable eu eu prevents restricting feature part rated forcing everyone adopt higher level functionality word cant block usbpd charger 3rd party support charging speed limiting 10w 25w supported rate port 32 speed cable host computer get higher speed equal apple third party
apple cant lock faster speed behind cable android phone 20 port
elaborate plz
huge content creator especially able record video directly external medium use external device couldnt people dont realize medium creation powerhouse modern smartphones huge unlock ton use case
people arent going use anyway invest effort time money feature instead something else make user happy like better camera durable design majority customer particular device model dont care cable transfer speed something utilize apple put effort make happen
nah sent item today via cable took many minute went eat running itd near instant usb 3 android year ago
ive literally never plugged phone data transfer id bet apple data showing dont like say important people sure apple doesnt really make thing say 5 user want priority unfortunate course pretty basic thing really presumably 10g usb 3 iphone 16 model though like island base model getting
using logic used absolutely useless feature overwhelming majority people headline upper end model
demand fastest possible everything particular reason
usb c 30 pro version one care
considering s23u internal storage cap 42gbps benefit 10gbps usb speed galaxy note series 5gbps since note 7 way back 2016 excuse least 5gb base iphone 15 2023
ah see long charging speed
may matter like 10gb transfer speed pretty fast unless im missing something unless talking straight gen 2 usb case apple suck end world wait next year guess
iphone 16 law come middle 2024 believe
know apple eu
pretty much upgrade series 5 apple watch ultra earlier year still access call text phone dy birth new daughter crappy battery im half considering upgrading 15 pro max battery life spacial video record memory
well incentive pro
think youve used promotion display length time cant go back conversely havent dont know youre missing dont care least thats apple likely betting
apple added pro motion phone id always complain aandroids better iphone screen ran 60hz iphone friend kept saying one need regular people cant notice diffference apple us feature main product segmentation incentive iphone lineup look like alota people able notice difference
dynamic island eventually become iphone se feature finally move faceid display year get rid notch
15 plus better 14 pro max basically
pretending need 120hz phone
good luck must scraping
im holding onto 13 mini new mini sadge
think right move 13p usbc obviously early potentially iphone16 could thunderbolt next year along potentially better spatial recording vision pro introducing 15p dont know good actually
pro promotion variable refresh rate 1hz 120hz depending pro 13 pro high refresh rate regular iphones capped 60hz refresh rate
ah pro 120 got interesting dont highlight fact anymore
11 pro max miss 7 lot really like iphone camera look fantastic though
im using 7 objectively better phone made 2023 almost every way thinner portable onehanded ridiculous photo overprocessing notch home button easily unlock phone even pocket touchid faceid using jailbroken tweak metal back doesnt shatter drop easily replaceable far stable io version 16 17 long animation able turned using jailbroken tweak saving hour wait time every week
mean ubenediktleb basically lol
way
time
variable refresh rate 1hz 120hz
pro since 13 pro 120hz variable refresh rate 13 pro went 10hz 1415 pro go 1hz alwayson display
pretty sure guess really cared macbook pro

yep 2 big noticeable jump refresh rate first going 3060hz noticeable immediately next one 60120hz isnt nearly big 3060hz 120hz shown youre diminishing return category get worse higher go
im using 90hz budget android im going replace new 15
ive using 144hz display since 2012 honestly dont mind 60hz phone
human eye cant really notice higher something like 23 hz maybe make difference responsive feel tapping swiping etc
imessage eu gatekeeper listhttpseceuropaeucommissionpresscornerdetailenip234328 european dont really use two messaging apps list whatsapp facebook messenger

google add datamine system
ill get right
think read somewhere reddit technology sub eu looking edit httpswwwredditcomrandroidcomments16bru8xeusparesapplefrommandatoryrcsfornowarticle
wdym allow apple adopt havent read document dont know usb consortium company decide common port use
airpod pro start coming usbc well apple watch already charging pod anyways charge ipad macbook iphone anything else modern cable
making sound like kindness heart eu
look apple theyve brought back magsafe hdmi port back macbook air lol
mean everywhere except phone apple essentially leading pack usbc basically true see dont use airpods apple watch
worked applecare ipads switched usbc yes lot vocal customer preferred continue lightning felt duped device different port lot customer like using plethora cable theyve accumulated remember cellphone first came nearly every model used different charger thats apple made long commitment assure customer would get longevity accessory
think ipads moved mac moved iphones didnt need think real hard lot harder already obviously clearly dispute point think youre making try cope cope stating objective fact coping seething think im defending company want criticize im actually correcting fact say 10 year commitment ask better apple committed port phone 5 year far better alternative usbc ready apple wanted drop old 30pin connector thats reason developed lightning apple one biggest force behind usbc weird think somehow problem concept 10 year commitment specifically result user accessory partner complaining dropping 30pin connector left lot useless product isnt debate dude dont mad argumentative believe know listen fact leave conversation bit smarter
exactly people still refuse believe clear point apple bet wrong horse term connector stuck lightning long plan 58 year ago without connector point never made effort change iphone usbc put plan motion well know wireless charging speed efficiency didnt evolve fast enough lightning got outdated every year stuck something actually dont want hand forced
rumor 15 usbc came iphone 13 come
fanboys people falsely claiming apple eu eu regulation even effect yet astonishing stupid sound
got 48mp main sensor 14pro soc dynamic island honestly thing sway away 60hz usb 20 90hz wouldve probably convinced get 15 instead 15 pro dont really care titanium dont really need 5x optical zoom s22 ultra briefly 10x optical zoom neat party trick thats dont need ray tracing phone 15 basically 14pro without 120hz aod
yep similar situation regard upgrading crappy xiaomi phone still 90hz display wanted upgrade get iphone 14 havent used apple product since 2015 wanted try something new shocked learn screen still 60hz lol wouldve even accepted 90hz screen aswell 60hz 2023 phone cost 1k im noooo way ended getting new galaxy s23 im happy considering waiting iphone 15 certain would least put higher refresh rate panel thought wrong quite disappointed also glad didnt waste time waiting guess ill stay phone another 2 3 year hopefully new iphones 120hz display
thats happens technology improves v early innovation cycle
iphone 7 8 work great
thanks id forgotten id kind wished keped naming 15 definately 14
talking overall design language group phone similarthe
se2 fine long dont make new mini model keep dy
arent saving planet arent shitting either neutral
dont tell mine 4 year old
strive rich
trillion dollar company way better
small startup give time
youre lucky
ive never used cable transfer file iphone since bought remember correctly ive never even used cable transfer anything old galaxy a51 well always uploaded cloud wonder job store huge file phone warrant file transfer speed
added new usb controller a17 pro support usb 3 since always going use a16 iphone 15 likely technical limitation stuck last year soc well see happens next year iphone 16 get a17
mean agree really penny pinching theyre using a16 15 usb2 controller theyd upgrade 15 a17 bit penny
usb 2 ancient product shipping vast majority user arent going care usb 2 transfer speed mean absolutely shipping usb 2 transfer speed thats mean additionally think youre factoring a16 chip
give week two youll likely adjust right back
pacific blue 12 clear
yea navy pretty nice
eh still consider iphone 12 blue color best
man iphone 13 line best color blue green red stunning color werent necessarily boring looked great phone remember upset 14 color le vibrant 15 color make look oversaturated comparison lol
sort consolation finewoven case 15 lineup available pacific blue reason yeah fan regular 15 blue either already incredibly pale blue frosted glass kind work making colour even washed
think eventually upgrade already embarrassing pixel 7a 90hz 500 along every flagship last 5 year im sure milk 60hz display long possible tho entice ppl get pro model dont really need camera
human eye cant see passed 60hz
im tell difference 60 m32uc m28u right m32uc 144hz thunderbolt bandwidth cap honestly absolutely cant tell difference maybe started pixel peeping everyday usage absolutely cant tell
wait till hear iphone even go 1 hz refresh rate battery life
wasnt point comment people know stuff mean might able tell huge majority people idea mean even pointed real time either cant tell dont care
probably one geek swe follow subreddit could give le fuck 120hz iphone sure like computer non issue phone
thats true id argue dont really care pro stuff want new iphone go daily routine apple made fortune customer gravy train appears pretty solid indeed
doesnt matter still 800 dollar lol
still excuse 60hz display 800 phone
swear remember people complaining refresh rate 12 came didnt notice anything going iphone 11 pro iphone 12 since 60 hz also didnt notice anything going iphone 12 iphone 13 pro increased refresh rate year using 13 pro using 12 noticed difference short people never experienced 60 hz never know go higher rate try move back
sheep everything defend forever
weird complacency logic average person cant tell difference a14 a16 shouldnt keep improving processor
remember argument bezel 8 v x average user care apple making calculated business move maximise profit
look like idk really matter spend 90 time phone reddit youtube
agree 99 people idea youre talking say people absolutely notice difference give 2 device one one without higher refresh screen dont know ive heard people comment much smoother one feel often think one phone powerful thing look nicer scrolling etc
terrible excuseand one got incredibly wrong say typical base iphone user know want x featureand even like said terrible excuse
ever used phone cold see refresh rate lowered going 120 60 feel like granted dont know wont hurt real cant go back situation cross
thats happily pay premium price base model type stuff
business perspective make ton sense people dont know refresh rate isand dont care meaning vast majority apple customer doesnt matter people care sort thing apple charge theyre offering different phone different type people charging money doubt would cost apple much add promotion regular model would make money using feature pro iphones course isnt desirable consumer like fortune 500 company apple isnt proconsumer company
excuse reason 99 iphone customer dont give two shit refresh rate would spend money add
lame logic apple keep using a14 since average person cant tell difference lower ppi display theyre imagine going people want money actual bootlicker logic
think nice price option dont need im really sure outside gaming youre seeing much effect 120hz really
explains business case think suck apple business doesnt care anything except money move make money part dance look whats offer decide whether youll pay pro upgrade get standard 15 hold year switch competitor
60hz fine 99 percent standard iphone user made standard iphone high refresh theyd see drastic drop sale pro model
tho company would spend money something know customer base doesnt want lol
excuse apple publicly traded company every decision make towards raising stock price saving 1 million unit still 1m
dont need excuse theyre business naive think otherwise dont care best interest disappoint expect otherwise
sure number people genuinely care vanishingly small would hardly worth cost
theyre saying customer driven way mean theyre saying profit driven based make financial sense try sell customer
mom cant tell difference id bet 50 yo cant either know atrocious motion smoothing left everyones tv tell difference btwn notch dynamic island migrate noticeable feature pro regular model retain nonnoticeable feature make pro seem like better value proposition
except added cost necessity
shush putting 120hz panel lot android total waste nothing marketing modern day equivalent selling consumer 5plus year old gpu shiny new name slapping 1tb vram itthe average person believe best understanding vram complete waste card utilize
seriously many android phone half market get support maybe 3 year apple support 6 maybe thats youre getting price tag
really fine dont like dont pay world continues turn
calculator cpu car infotainment system support addition modem gps etc software doesnt support course run version freertos could programmed work
get feeling throwing usb2 cable need buy usb3 cable based something guy said usb 3 cable optional
probably
yep usb 2 15 non pro
would crazy wouldnt
14 pro last year model
could 2015 2014 came google search
usb c introduced 2012 apple didnt start adopting 2014
completely missed point go ahead defend trillion dollar company
shit year refused use iphones look u weve year eu forcing hand even idiot get enjoy courageous
red think 6 7 loved phone hate able get bright red pro even regular phone right
thats probably theyll announce new iphone se
somehow made hate octavia spencer screen
agree need go back live keynote
sorry shouted soon pretty sure mentioned product red must watch sorry
requires sheep blood
said besides camera titanium probably gon na matter much wear revealing titanium underneath glass vulnerable resulting repair
telling youve never wanted fold iphone half
300 poco 144hz display thing apple drip feed year
using 13 pro currently really never problem
agree id bit lighter would perfect
lol yall arent going leave ecosystem 60hz display
well havent bought iphone since 2017 guess nonempty long
im also regularly randroid
lol euro stay losing
none matter
mean like alaska
lmfao 25 sale tax joke right
live 25 sale tax edit appears answer europe although wouldnt expect european use sign
oh ok
mmm atm euro close dollar tend use interchangeably 7 cent difference
mean lot mini usb mostly died ton old cable still always happen still find funny android user could charge phone newer ipad macbook charger iphone people couldnt time device using usbc 2 work laptop personal laptop usbc ear bud keyboard mouse use charge easy travel 13 cable use usbc apple fault holding long probably still would eu said apple could trade program offer discount buying new phone really cared environment want good pr
ah understood initially misread said though day come entire house usb device well tossing old lightning cable rather buying adapter continue using existing cable
get youre coming apple produce adapter cable theyre dropping support flagship product would antithetical goal carbon neutral plus apple like outsourcing lightning cable 3rd party manufacture reduces carbon footprint company level cut cost manufacturing get charge royalty 3rd party manufacturer
aliexpress full fill demand super super quick assume like 125 adapter everywhere might even decent price
haha yeah good point make adaptor cheap af wear cost people dont throw away current cable charger even include box free still usb 20 speed nothing really changed except connector
even said something along line usbc become recognized industry standard connector weve added iphone 15
mean could watch stream
except limiting factor a16 chip doesnt handle speed theyd bump a17 next year thats concern guess havent transferred anything via copper since 30pin day really dont care
im going slap opaque case phone ill know mind color
isnt absurd offer white black option consistently year
sku nightmare lmao
get usbc change device use usbc know buying new hardware iphone airpods suck one responsible people admit thats apple
yeah true plenty usb c device intent purpose standardisation socket least capability different usb cablesports varies still huge step forward welcome said lightening still place heart design stood test time well also give credit apple shunning micro usb every manufacturer adopting really diabolical design rightfully deserved die quickly
one thing dont like usbc flimsy connector inside inability tell cableport much datapower carry connection work feel like connecting stuff expecting work hopefully get little symbol setup something example cable carry 40w 60w usbc port pd arent hard drive connect iphone anything draw power dont know
fuck usbc cable
yeah agreed bet apple actually put time detail like way premium car company put time getting right click weighting button dial cabindashboard probably way company well given theyre short resource dedicate small detail
isnt great better nintendo switch hp laptop usbc dock station replace port switch cost almost much used switch cause tiny prong found hopefully apple take small board ribbon cable main board fix faulty port
since understand technology well tell usecase data transfer via cable average iphone user
arent insulting people unlike understand real people actually use base model phone dont care wired transfer speed understand using last year chip save million people stupid reason want professional photography videography iphones buy pro model
wow right always remove pro model dont remember guess since phone dont change much year year
pixel line put dirt cheap phone went toe toe photo video least good basic iphone model course iphone pro still dominated video performance quality okay respect competition sometimes android phone hardware software thing force apple innovate thats good
ended fool dang
dont know little difference image taken pixel phone iphones day
iphone se similar 6
reminded dozen 30 pin connector kept cable box case ever need one
iphone nobody ever happy anything
literally phone android recently bought apple phone
im still 11 max pro forest green jumping 15 max pro titanium white current plan availability storereservations allow im rush
samsung run android way would better
bluetooth headphone much better wireless headphone even competition noone want wired headphone back phone company phased headphone jack boomer
well thats dumb thank apple mfi eco system car unit android auto apple car play would hate think youd swap usb cable time switch android apple cause need apple certified cable u usb stand universal work
true expect carplay work proper usbc cable issue many usb cable actually spec
curious security reason would
absolutely however save money harden case incursion water othererliquids
really see need honestly neither 27w honestly fast enough
apple force downloaded u2 album onto everyones iphone 2014
add narwhal statement country time didnt unlimited data people phone filled time iphones tended interesting problem occur people phone full
damn wish theyd give mine advance
wow someone brain concept
maybe specify dude 25k 25k penny
american product american website
cry
youre voted also shitty attitude dont get twisted
guess people downvoting comment replied boat whats funny actually want matte phone 13 slippery dropped immediately shatted case arrived never broken phone life buy apple insurance fact got replaced put straight case doesnt matter happy time upgrade nice one ya
haha wish im luckily happily married longer worry thinking new phone tech attractive opposite sex like get occasional haircut dress respectfully though bit cheaper le harmful planet well
thank wasnt sure charging speed wouldve impacted
right reason average consumer wont understand
wireless speed beating available wired interface device especially considering 80211 half duplex wrong get supposed phone usb 20 old spec well established across industry penetrating consumer device market iphone invented would almost prefer firewire usb 20
exactly example gigabit ethernet v 10 gb ethernet consumer device still using 1gb definitely didnt mention anywhere
cheap usb thumbdrives support usb 3
never significant upgrade iphone least three year
bro least several cent per unit
normie whose medium life
exactly made pro feature
content creator reason get pro
know going put 16 make look like upgrade cost put negligible apple scale change design stuff anyways implement usb c could done time typical apple stuff intentionally gimping thing make product future one look better comparison
bet way 5 bet le percent people desire usb2 speed blind speculation though
maybe iphones integrated file management system would actually want use portable 512gb ssd guess apple hsers literally cant complain feature dont know exist
yes always use high end model subsidize widely used phone
reason twist word make point didnt say one care use word actually used think question answer
excuse basically nobody buying base 15 care people likely going go pro android phone anyway
doesnt even require charging speed requirement device charged usbc nothing data transfer even must charged usbc technically could included lightning well limited usbc charging 01w something absurd like
nope october 2024 mean iphone 16 already released grandfathered old law
apple released lightning said standard next 10 year 11th anniversary promise switch usbc think likely promised customer shareholder port standard would exist 10 year kept promise week 11th anniversary decided carve legislative pressure two year early
bro swear god pro model line stupidest shit ever saw stuck regular iphone iphone plus naming scheme
couldve atleast chipped 90hz display non pro model
imo regular iphones 120hz difference pro get promotion display nonpros either locked 120hz set 60hz 120hz
working like incentive samsung tbh
pretty much thing make get pro nonpro know theyre
camera main selling point pro
thats question 15 plus 120hz display
probably 799 premium phone youd expect premium feature
90 would nice
youre spending 800 premium phone 2023 doesnt feature midrange android
120hz burn screen much faster 60hz android user dont care buy new phone every 23 year anyway due lack update security patch general instability cheap hardware component
agreed dealer buying 13 said 13 14 pretty much exactly went 13 cheaper good 14 dont urge upgrade especially paid cell phone bill get cut half
got thanks im 11pro gimped battery probably upgrade wish itll good upgrade iphone 2 3g 5 xupgraded 11pro due x shitting bed holding
someone else mentioned 14 good camera upgrade lens maybe much complaining going overprocessing think 12pm produce better photo
camera 120hz really major bump dynamic island something guess camera jump first one huge 120hz also pretty massive
thats entirely different thing pwm dimming nothing refresh rate
ive changed pixel 6 90hz 60hz see feel
feeling may factor though
myth still around
ever used 120 hz 90 hz device go doctor cant tell difference 60 hz lmao normal human absolutely tell difference
tv sale circuit city 2006 take lol everyone tell difference btw 23hz 60hz lesser extent 120hz granted im generally happy 60
lmao serious
mistaken
id say please congress usually ask useful thing tend opposite
aye whatsapp already begun work integration leak suggested yesterday
european care much data privacy love messaging service owned facebookmeta dont get imessage encrypted since release whatsapp started using signal protocol 2018 9 year release
exactly let keep making everything closedpeople like insufferablethey could still follow rcs protocol added layer protection made themthere many way could le restrictive still safe
either apple pick poison
know realistically way afford upgrade everything time fact watch requires proprietary charger also charge airpods wont charge phone phone use wireless charger wont work watch work airpods quite ridiculous
pretty obviously going making switch already promised 10 year lightning came 2012 make sense waited since everyone flipped much changed 30pin perhaps eu ruling made change happen faster card
macbook air hdmi port
yeah apple bet big manufacture accessory pc laptop going hard usbc come fruition ill honest though fine usbc port ruined early macbooks overly thin body usbc port durability port 2017 macbook except 1 partially functional big reason accidental tug ac power cord causing wear usbc port
airpods companion device iphone obviously theyre going keep charging cable apple watch wireless charge really sure point
worked applecare ipads switched usbc yes lot vocal customer preferred continue lightning felt duped device different port sound like could solved apple switching device usbc time also apple could include adaptor ease customer transition wanted didnt
thats apple made long commitment assure customer would get longevity accessory using world wide standard like usb wanted milk customer worked applecare know true thanks eu finally forced proconsumer practice
meh fine believe want
lightning got outdated every year stuck something actually dont want crazy cause ipad pro went usbc macbook one point dont understand didnt lol
introduced last minute europe banned phone
price get 14 pro man 15 scam
wouldnt smarter get 14pro lol
fair everything iphone 12 could iphone 12 sss
oh ok yeah fair enough
know sometimes hard believe im among small population iphone user actually like mini form factor comfortable hold thought would popular
buy carbon neutral product dont contribute global warming save world feel good consumerism lifestyle justified buy product
believe im really lol firm grip apple care use case im working though
mean thats mixed logic eg vast majority user dont need a12 chip apple going ship a16 reason apple using usb 20 arent enough people challenge reason stuck lightning year like finally conceded middle finger dont really care find amusing apple really doesnt give concession
dont 120160hz device really hard go back pc monitor 144hz macbook pro 120hz spend couple hour pc macbook go back 60hz pretty jarring experience adjust minute use damn 60hz feeling using device
happened 60hz felt choppy like 45 day became norm look fine
yeah would want lol
pretty nice great prefer 12 pro blue
sort consolation finewoven case 15 lineup available pacific blue reason thats weird sure want buy another overpriced apple phone case experience 12 pro leather case though broke le 15 year
dude gf picked used pixel 5 already 90hz im actually pissed smooth scrolling compared iphone 13
wont people paying 1000 every year goddman phone
youre human eye
pixel peeping trying look
feel way like 5 thing nothing necessitates 120hz
lol glad im one
think base model profitable pro pro max model
better processor better battery life make using phone faster smoothness scrolling swiping isnt something iphone user complain never problem iphones always smooth scrolling compared android one original thing separated
truly average user going annoyed old lightning cable wont work new phone
scrolling reddit way smoother 120hz v 60 like said another guy matter experience try go back course look fine youre used
12 doesnt 120
shit theyre 60 hz
bring 48mp camera base 15 range consumer wouldnt even know raw stand much le enable whereas promotion feature user could experience every moment use phone like rest world android screwed calling promotion making people believe pro feature
feel like 90hz would good compromise nonpro phone would allow better compete android phone offer high refresh screen phone costing half price regular 15 still differentiation 120hz pro phone
bootlicker dont care refresh rate people use term anybody disagrees word meaningless anymore
experience 120hz using phone daily task gaming scrolling animation becomes extremely smooth apps
100 budget android phone would fine 99 people thats terrible excuse 800 smartphone 2023 200 android phone 120hz display feel noticably smoother upcoming iphone 15 like would expensive implement create better product segmentation
fine dont know better sure 99 percent standard iphone user fine a15 chipso dont think apple upgraded either right
theyd see drastic drop sale pro model yes 60hz fine
90hz
made standard iphone high refresh theyd see drastic drop sale pro model sound like need better stuff differentiate model go argument decreased sale simple feature withholding almost 5 year old industry standard tech customer arbitrary reason bad thats deciding factor pro good enough theyre confident enough rest differentiator
dont bring logic
120hz display phone start around 400 excuse apple flagship pricing entry level phone spec iphone spec worse 400 phone spec flagship phone even variable refresh rate feature let phone go 120hz 10hz save battery life depending youre reading watching video static screen feature theyre gon na release line pull classic new feature iphone available phone 4 year
really wont like 120hz display apple keep artificially gimping transfer speed people notice care buying pro phone anyway dont agree gimping however literally 99 people airdrop access stuff via cloud anyways people back via icloud people rarely connect phone macpc hardware back anymore like backup external ssd photo case reason icloud data shit bed nicheminority case someone filming enough content regularly save time via usb 3 transfer also minority case
youve 120hz wont buy phone without every time use iphone feel sluggish comparison refresh rate
0 idea talking
samsung support phone 5 year spec get price order magnitude better comparison sake base iphone 15 price s23 ultra keep using card defend apple cheaping though
ah age old nobody forcing buy retort kind valid complaint
yeah thats standard phone also
usb2 speed nonpros pro get 10gbps use correct cable kinda sound like wont provide one petty af
well thats disappointing
7 putting white bezel phone mistake totally wouldve gotten one black
maybe
ah good point saw comment saying pro somehow missed comment camera yea titanium
remember bending iphone like beckham
really isnt big deal sure suck expensive phone doesnt really change nothing ipad pro could 60hz wouldnt care
especially idea going fucking samsung lol
much lifetime hospital bill 0 lost

realize implicit messaging apple pricing make green claim appear spurious best
dont know unit cost remember applebranded minijack lightning adapter like 10 buck still using mine
people dont realize apple worked intel hp microsoft invent type c 2014 one first use product 2015 indeed irritating waited forced use phone people behavior irritating yall remember phone charging iphone came along right
meant cant release usbc call something else designtechnology probably patented name fancy name
transferring song video especially 4k video wait never mind transferring data different device may little complicated apple user ive since 1998 id appreciate extra speed especially 800 dollar usb 20 came 2000 fucking get time
absolutely insulting intelligence youre minimizing damage usb c enjoy simplicity iphone continue use still every year disappointing announce old thing innovation 2010 anymore people smart enough keep technology know apple treating people dumb dont tech savvy need use technology
firerescue stock apple cord trash weve somewhat better luck anker one go usbc cord year lighting cable dozen year lightning cable seems one contact side wear away killing cable rubber break nothing usually near connector never issue stock samsung apple usbc cable
sister wedding literally day launch 23rd know photographer want picture share day excited year probably getting blue pairing caramel tanned leather case andar supply fast enough
spec whore better
bluetooth headphone much better wireless headphone even competition oh guess bluetooth isnt considered wireless technology anymore noone want wired headphone back speak please phone company phased headphone jack yeah apple showed u strip feature make people pay even defend decision social medium
prevent use said button theyre wet cant tell thumb made skin something else
bad
also took lot space lot people like 8gb storage time
remember
pretty easy assume im american omg different information either joking incorrect info arent american
ive 15 country none sell iphone 799
first world problem hey
longer worry thinking new phone tech attractive opposite sex sure anyone age 16 worry
weve fast charging usbc thing
doesnt make ok fact taken long ditch usb 2 speed joke
doesnt excuse still using usb2 2023 thought apple meant innovative
would sure ipad mini usb 3 a15 ipad air 10gb despite using desktop class soc previous generation pro supported 40
explain 5 year old ipad pro using a12 usb 3 gen 2
cheap usb thumb drive barely maintain speed second crappy flash chip cant keep
dont know consideration however someone using data transfer mean heavy content transfer meaning probably extremely high quality video photograph person really isnt going get 15 theyd get pro theyd get much dont think lot people actually transfer massive amount gb phone back via cable really make sense add youre creating content im also aware android phone usb30 transfer speed could wrong
maybe wasnt using usb 20 speed apple trained user wired connection phone awful wonder one
direct agreeing actively market useless feature high end model
thats sweeping generalisation photo video bigger ever airdrop unreliable barely faster usb2 available pc even small percentage people ever use talking basic feature thats market several year im still amazed people happily excuse apple excluding basic feature 800900 device
bro case wouldnt upset eu enforcing usbc nothing apple making 10 year promise also standard next 10 year doesnt mean change 10 year mean last least 10 year changed ipad pro usb still kept everything else lighting case apple would made everthing usbc back
plus larger size pro additional feature pro max whats dumb large version pro either max pro plus entire modern apple naming scheme shit mac m2 m2 pro m2 max m2 ultra max pretty much larger combination base module
plus isnt ego stroking pro focus tested plus give folk semi pro make one get hard figure
ya business standpoint dumb idea people going buy iphone regardless would apple ever something nice nice hurt profitability
apple enabled option 120hz didnt specifically notify user default would wager 90 would remain 60hz iphone user phone fashionable appliance
noticeable user wouldnt care
yup earth would pay 800 iphone 15 could get brand new s23 680 120hz screen telephoto camera etc 800 model legitimately scam
well brought 14 pro camera 15 model sound like 2nd priority
believe 15 plus 60hz id like buy one 120hz thing swaying towards 14 pro max
people buying regardless cut profit like
agree make smoother experience suspect reason mostly due hit battery life
lmfao panel die faster higher refresh rate stop nonsense fact flagship iphone doesnt high refresh display fucking disgrace 2023
explain put worse feature according onto pro model
paid part really seal deal lol
13 pro 14 pro 120hz might want consider one well
oh thats good know got ten month old need good photo course far happy 12pm produce maybe compare
blergh tried p6p night day difference smoothness
well filibuster kind problem
european basing privacy trust basing fear meta apple would get blasted private data leaked used inappropriately doesnt matter one use apps based convenience messenger used everyone facebook whatsapp used mobile number easy get people use viber
world europe 70 population us android ie access imessage world bigger blue v green bubble bullcrap sold apple fanatic
everyone data open system available every advertising engine nope thanks corporate shill
definitely apple
sure thats shortcoming apple wireless charging downside migrating lightning ubiquitous usbc
happens year would legally requerided
think meant macbook pro
think le others going hard usb c people apple realizing inconvinient carry around dongle commonly used port built magsafe biggest removal im glad brought back new macbooks get new one
mostly everything except phone usbc come apple besides airpods much companion laptop tablet phone
transitioned early people like would called liar reneging 10 year lightning commitment andor called money grab make people get new accessory include adapter creates ewaste anyone doesnt need adapter eu would make law punishing go back look apple movedon 30pin people upset even though lightning better every way people like perpetually mining salt
milking customer change ipads year ago didnt make commitment lightning ipads iphones also could released another model year iphones lighting year continue milking customer need compliant didnt switched year 10 year promise expired also eu worried customer protection dont target eu company like bmw innovating thing like heated seat subscription seems anticonsumer alternate charging port
trump thats real life work cant believe want come fact objectively true apple committed using lightning iphone 10 year objectively true 10 year period ended year objectively true apple already migrated almost entire product line usbc prior iphone adopting well objectively true eu usbc regulation apply year product know fact conclude theyre making change theyre forced
last minute deadline christmas 2024 iphone 16 could legally lightning phone sold way entire lifespan port change came year standard threeyear body update
could say going back iphone 2g get 14 get 13 pro get 13 get 12 pro get 12 get 11 pro get 11 get x
patch
thank dont get people like big smartphones like want game watch stuff get ipad iphone communication want small thin possible sad missed 13 mini point se new even consider edit iphone 15 mini usbc would perfect
consider opposite wealthy also dropped caseless iphone 12 time count onto concrete asphalt tile deep end pool recently phone slid top bunk refugio hit tile floor impact basically woke everyone room phone still shattered still look basically new ever since ceramic shield new phone way durable purpose covering phone market crap hiding view making bulkier allowing dirt build added gap crease case screen protector grift unless youre construction worker prone decking phone ground rage really dont need extra plastic shit adhered phone anymore
apple care rich
overpriced cloud storage dollar month 50 extra gig whats fairly price opinion lol
idk use google storage never really thought cheap digital data id need want share mostly web anyway day except maybe family photo video
think youre overestimating people actually use data transfer usb iphones dont believe number people low thing like a16 chip significant amount highly tech savvy people indeed utilize a16 chip lot devs sysadmins pentesters mlai people use a16 chip take grain salt anecdote know several people field none use port anything charging likely utilize a16 chip
yee turn low battery mode feel 60hz instantly cant go back lol
true video game 120hz like night day difference everything feel silky smooth imo prob necessary phone screen would nice would noticeable
pacific blue best iphone colour ever
like staring screen purposefully spot difference
id argue people nothing even necessitates new iphone draw line 60hz v 120hz reason 90hz least 800 phone going whats necessary doesnt need new iphone
unless daily phone high refresh rate display really wont understand people pushing high refresh rate display phone
idea know apple make killing however certainly wouldnt surprise
dont complain havent experienced better okay love complacency
average user whatever maximising profit
whoop thought started 12 bad
know guess likely compete samsungs abnormally large mp size apple probably determined consumer research mp size much larger defining factor purchasing rather display hz easily compare mp size phone 120hz promotion adding onto apple rarely us term hz marketing phone say display promotion grandma comparing samsung apple samsung might say 120hz display apple say promotion one think make sense purchase based naming alone id bet left airpod apple found promotion make sense sound desirable come trust consumer place apple consistently good feature thus reason put pro phone regular lineup feature marketing huge factor apple lock likely contributes segregating feature
probably cropped telephoto thing without extra lens
average person want better photo refresh rate
bigger number look better marketing especially absurd mp android device day even though know doesnt matter postprocessing software camera sensor optic average joe doesnt understand know friend 48mp 50mp whatever shiny new android
could theyll recoup sensor cost volume
48mp one zoom without another lens thats already amazing people
even dont care doesnt mean people want money thats bootlicking theyre caring company interest
ehhhhh fine people dont even notice
owned phone 144hz display daily driving 13 mini honestly say 60hz fine daily use
dont waste time sub trying reasonable discussion
14 pro 13 mini 120hz nice isnt deal breaker
oh please enlighten mr wizard 120hz panel essential phone today android vastly superior ill wait
lol httpswwwandroidauthoritycomsamsungandroidupdates1148888 taking thing step samsung announced february 2022 whole bunch galaxy device eligible four year android update youre one also samsung 24httpsgsstatcountercomvendormarketsharemobile market share nowhere close many android phone half market whatever actually mean
mean right though half user apple thread act like dont even upgrade phone decade nobody forcing stay 60hz phone option
common low mid tier android device many iphone 15 price range arent usb3 suitable cable
still suck tho
yep didnt mind liked white given choice prefer white red one another color new color super boring right even regular model

pixel 7 looking mighty sweet though usb 32 90hz 12 price
u know part screen iphone samsung made part right samsung hate lol exactly bad
well suck still got good trade value
problem
man people sub cant take joke smh
wait hear place outside u
producing adapter oh shit new thought already product line could wrong point adapter pricing cable cause consumer toss old cable entirely ensuring trash landfill producing idea pricing messed look greenwashing threw u agree first part statement dont agree characterization greenwashing apple made carbon neutral 2023 announcement turn decade intent purpose theyre steadily moving towards goal dont think eu forcing either drop eu customer change hardware antithetical goal think apple stuck rock hard place dont want welcome eu legislation fully supporting pivot itll make playable pawn also dont want push much burden consumer appear though theyre maliciously complying
yeah true id say made price people like may well get new usb c cable charger im half way
phone charging iphone connector many brand used usb
okay wrong people dont use wifi sync work one transferring song computer mp3 collection iphone anymore guess pirating movie 90 need rest u moved
including feature one use apple calling stupid sigh
dont expect know order iphone 15 fully unlocked pick apple store live near apple store im att customer existing iphone 11 main phone number hoping could buy iphone 15 person swap sim somehow transfer esim dont want order att thing theyll ship house dont trust many package stolen id rather buy iphone 15 pay full carry person att store transfer number unless home ive done lot corporate iphones way moving sim new phone id rather convert esim possible
well lol
funny bono even talk autobiography basically apologizing say thats band intended thing play fair definitely fault whatsoever apple could literally done anything fix
mine 16 gb model sitting 13 gb got album lol
instead assuming someone ignorance take step back realize replying familiar sorry american dont acknowledge existence every second day instead 25k couldve put currency following people regard american product english speaking platform would make guess whereas competent people non american use currency avoid confusion
99 problem first world bullshit everyone chill
think biologically thing choose attractive opposite sex keeping gene going gene pool subconsciously lot time clothes wear car drive live hobby actshow social medium apple sexy brand marketing best world airpods make x percent attractive making music making art editing video ipad cool attractive lot people phone maybe le many choose long time iphone actually exciting people owning apple product make u thinkare creative actually somewhat attractive etc im making proven research obviously isnt everyone generalization brand brand powerful im probably slightly aware work design advertising apple always standard producing creative work
give example
dont know single person transferred data iphone via cable year reality average consumer never use feature people use people likely buy pro anyways excuse explanation
yep thank lol locked behind essentially paywall apple small tech company without resource make happen
innovate way take advantage people
ok base iphone 15 cant even second ton cheaper android phone
dont want talk anymore nice day
really excuse true consider asking parent nontech friend last time plugged phone pc airdrop definitely unreliable lol practically use daily basis ig youre talking icloud syncing
bro case wouldnt upset eu enforcing usbc upset law passed got asked interview senior president something basically shrugged said follow law country operate
iphone 7 7 plus happy 6 6 plus happy 8 8 plus happy fine give u feature phone like use screen size battery difference pro stuff
long ive wanted apple simplify iphone xx iphone xx pro even iphone year iphone pro year different size dont need different name people know whether want big one small one select size want
pro max always different feature pro plus denotes larger size max denotes maximum feature quite simple dont know got ta get mad reason
doesnt mean shouldnt available people pay even baseline phone including se 120hz included especially included cheaper phone manufacture
ask million people buy baseline phone nobody know theyd care price device included
wrong sub blind apple hate bud

14 pro still better phone compared iphone 15
mm im really arguing lot people using merely usb3 standard year a16 probably support usb3 apple deliberately chose limit usb2
yes first time ever nonstandard color phone ie black second saw presentation sold
need notice difference pc move mouse around quickly move window around see difference especially obvious thing like fps game high enough frame rate phone possibly obvious normal use feel much smoother scrolling swiping around dont stare hard screen see
trade value recent phone walk away paying anywhere 2300 buck upgrade 13 pro max im considering trading sell potential highest resale price
need explain know use real life wont agree anyway something experienced
possible could change mind also sit front 144hz pc like 8hrs day
generally point business wont last long dont care profit
reason apple used retina even though android phone higher ppi
hit nail head plus better camera mean gunna get hdr video ufo sooner later right
mp number really doesnt make difference except people brag spec sheet sensor small doesnt matter
go angry somewhere else arent owed everything want anybody
like headphone youve used gotten accustomed something better going back entry level disappointing people would probably also fine driving car 70 progress halted well look soviet motor stick 60 tech collapse nowadays nobody want deal problem considering going io getting used ipad definitely dont want phone feel sluggish shame since hardware easily strong enough
ill never forget excited show people 120hz iphones store work sell got oh thats neat
didnt say android superior iphone 14 pro im happy sister regular 14 experience using worse old a21 300 phone 2020 thanks 30hz referesh rate shit try actually using one glaring difference

lol cool hear could put button itunes something
technically max rated power output usb2 port 500ma 25w tablet phone etc supported even required power since like decade ago
normally id aboard hate train one except transferring picture ive never needed copy file tofrom phone guess thats reserved pro model
yes wireless faster usb2 year apple pitched airdrop usb3 far far faster iphones wifi
also dont make easy lol detest itunes
thats one would make known tried transferring file tried transferring data 14 pro via cable gave realized slow
hi copied 40gb music collection phone
wait isnt paywall though chip iphone 15 doesnt support usb 30 like case hardware support disconnect disable software
youre assuming every nonpro iphone user nontechie dont look far riphonehelp see plenty people issue transferring large number photo video airdrop fine small stuff kind thing youd want usb3
along law shouldnt get involved business let business sort
counterpoint money tho dont care ignore pro line
business selling extremely well going dediversify product
cause pro max sound like call max also many pro max model extra feature regular pro
dont think wrong price really doesnt lot bearing luxury good unfortunate reality iphone doesnt compare manufacturer compare previous phone people want io ecosystem going consider android device simply better value money
youre right let survey million people im allowed voice opinion think people buy iphones casual user literally wouldnt notice
calling 800 iphone 15 scam blind apple hate sheep npc opinion 1000 iphone 15 pro among best phone price point blind hate happening blind look price point realize youre fucking fooled buying phone model offer notably le feature competitor
really arguing priority 1 v priority 2 rn let agree need go outside touch grass
provide evidence higher refresh rate speed degradation panel
barely noticeable difference begin ive got 120 hz android 60 hz iphone definitely noticeable difference princess
get samsung
iirc earmark went away year ago point going damn near impossible get 60 vote anything regulating telecommunication day
shit sherlock
mm im really arguing lot people using ignoring factor doesnt mean part rationale a16 probably support usb3 would bumped a17 chip would nonnegligible bump price feature practically zero people desire
first nonblackgrey id
im saying cant tell unless im going way stare screen notice something im sure people
feature first released apple first market kind pixel density
got mp crop usable 12 mp apple take baseline
thanks proving nothing challenge point keep keeping boot clean
eh value consistency stability latest greatest nothing phone would benefit 120hz look better flicking screen really fast care
would rather extra hour battery 120hz
think meant like 6 year numbered full io release security update
lol learn difference update security update theyre would update youre talking one android vendor le 25 worldwide market vast majority android phone dont even get paltry level support
ive used samsung apple year end day theyre phone 95 thing wasnt social stigma america using android phone would undoubtedly still samsung
pixel fan brand shit ton qa issue disliked samsung make sense
oh sorry didnt realize wasnt allowed like
want get regular 15 never really understood people always got expensive option
like 30pin connector used ipod iphone im really sure youre getting used similar proprietary connector everyone moved miniusb mid 2000s microusb eventually usbc apple stuck 30pin 2012 introduced lightning
unable accept care everyone else need learn everyone else world isnt wrong different opinion
whoa crazy im glad asked bookmark youd think know mdm corp gov organization get little anxious device phone number lot 2fa code go
thanks appreciate ive transferred esim esim new way hold 2 iphones near pretty slick remember especially corporate managed phone old legacy sim esim bit cumbersome guess nice thing type situation phonenumber continues work old phone im rush wipe sell old phone att account actually 2 iphones w 2 independent number since mdm mobile device management living think duplication fallback something go sideways
itunes went away macos year ago feel bad window user still stuck
mean youre wrong however hardware limitation thats apple figure could dump a17 generic iphone 15 call day still losing even penny know apple operate thing said 120hz display technically behind paywall day age reason standard iphone limited 60hz even sub 200 android phone offer 90hz yet pro model 1k offer higher hz display say behind literally paywall lol fully opinion know everyone agrees
say think offered valid concern eu evaluate successor usbc eu made adjustment law response concern addressed didnt really respond law changing port phone
problem pro line siphoning feature away regular iphone
pro model dont think would sell nearly many phone overall make sense cheaper version dont need bell whistle kind like saying mercedes benz sell class would giving ton market share
never said couldnt voice opinion pointed made assumption want million apple customer without evidence support claim
sheep npc opinion didnt even state opinion yet youve deemed sheep npc one hilarious didnt say couldnt dislike iphoneapple calling new phone scam doesnt meet standard simple exaggeration one forcing anyone buy iphone 15 trick deception scam like samsung congrats saying youre going get much discourse agreement apple sub day new device announced
youre one started really argument youre wrong
lol gratz every 60hz screen look appears laggy guess better start upgrading screen keep consuming brother never stop buying meanwhile ill using 5 year old iphone faster computing power brand new android dont stop buying phone baby enjoy 2 security update per lifecycle phone
cool man im saying usb30 standard year apple shipping thats really
stability consistency hows odds higher refresh rate anything app dropping frame le deal 17ms v 8ms next frame leading better consistency scroll lot lowered delay touching something happening noticable battery saver kicking forcing 60hz night day
irrelevant update dont work two platform ton update stuff handled play store service example dont need full system update update system apps like io reason
95 thing yep tell lot people either used shitty android apple bit polish samsung bit feature everything else pretty much easy avoid getting locked either ecosystem
lol purchase phone based perceived social stigma
indeed make sense arent simpleton
want trade value ill keep 11 pro another 2 year least
make sure 2fa transfer new phone first resetting old one recommend using google newer 2fa since cloud based device based
agree like wouldnt cost anything sell lot iphones hundred million 1 saved mean hundred million saved something consider still company made choice especially chip wouldnt say could drop a17 15 cost literally bought tsmcs supply 3nm technology even cost money im sure anyone would able make enough apple time maybe definition paywall could argue display certainly chip
concern regulation drive conformity across different type connector built smart phone freeze innovation rather encourage proposal bad environment unnecessarily disruptive customer anyone read say apple doesnt want going put usbc iphone wouldnt even addressed company always shit say start getting regulated apple probably wanted avoid usbc together go port le got blind sighted eu apple really wanted embrace usbc iphones would done started putting usbc ipad pro fact didnt plus statement prof eu made implement usbc iphones even whether ahead schedule doesnt really matter
doubt would sell base iphone 799 pro feature
need evidence say think
apple shipping nearly every iphone user world disagrees certainly thats wrong entire rest world right
lowered delay touching something happening noticable arent getting thing done faster loading exact going downvote continuing conversation
yeah im convinced sub never anything iphone
social stigma affected ability casual hookup yes gladly took trade
yeah simpleton need call 911 without phone crashing httpswwwredditcomrgooglepixelcommentsxwjnf2pixel6profailedtoconnectto911lastweek

dang glad reminded older sm code 10 account setup microsoft authenticator preferred lot work microsoft azure based also bought 2 x yubikeys year ago 5ci version lightning usbc work problem new iphone usbc ive used yubikey recently setup new macbook pro authorize appleid worked smooth could lot think day security p
argument youre using said display lol new display pro amoled 120hz ofc business doesnt make sense drop a17 regular 15 people wouldnt care spend ridiculous asking price pro model point still stand better hardware locked behind paywall previously stated apple wont know operate extremely anti consumer bad worse nintendo screwing customer end day eat im guilty iphone 12 upgrading every year still 12 pro max isnt going anywhere point usbc enough care upgrade moment considering going back samsung trying android first time 10 year fold 5 really tempting lol
id argue would 120 hz screen iphone 15 15 plus

would 799 though
didnt say nobody want 120hz said base iphone user wouldnt care phone locked 60hz

year whats new cycle
gon na get promax dividend pay otherwise keep 14pro max
got white 14 pro wanted shiny frame im disappointed arent shiny iphones anymore
clearly coloring titanium proving problem
new action button shouldnt replace silent toggle switch rather separate button beneath power button
even point anymore nothing change
whats button power button
action button seemingly working one action huge bummer double tap triple tap etc multiple function thatd amazing maybe even somehow mix physical button haptic capacitative button way wont accidentally trigger pocket pressure
really hoping 120 hz would trickled base model year ive itching swap 14 pro max due godawful weight
phone innovation really stagnated hasnt like cool everything better battery life better camera else
upgrade 12 pro max hold another year
iphone 12 pro homies yall upgrading im thinking battery going shit camera crack feature boring like neutral color

pro version usbc 30 v regular 15 version 20 big difference matter
15 pro 05x ultra wide 1x main 2x main 48mp cropped 3x telephoto
new iphone 15 pro also feature rumored action button place mute switch apple zero idea want
love know got rid camera filtering effect included way turn somehow 11 pro still take realistic photo need know still worth holding onto
titanium texture look like perfect hiding place bacteria
pro max titanium white look decent cant tell picture shade grey seem common want something different time

apple event im telling everyone im buying house 3 pro year well make tighten belt 30 minute apple event finish im apple store app pre ordering 3 phone

pink really like reserved peasant iphone 15 pro
ive loved pro iphones ive always hated color option buy silver neutral ever gave u bold color would ditch silver iphone heartbeat seeing gorgeous colorinfused glass regular 15 excited thinking would finally bring u good option 15 pro sadly wrong probably boring year pro color ever nobody asked third shade gray dull navy blue blah color im really hoping listen customer feedback time around offer least one bold exciting color 16 proultra
mine go case anyway couldnt care le
50 shade pick
apple making easy switch android
yeah color across whole line underwhelming boooo
mean black white also shade grey
im glad like blue
grey sophisticated
wanted buy pro hate colour
wait buy since like surprise launch new color 6 month

deciding factor believe apps shouldnt randomly close smartphones 2023 edit missing word factor mind drift sometimes lol
said dinner
uncle work apple confirmed well
read anywhere
theyre really going put resident evil assassin creed thing better
wife getting spatial september 22nd edit dammit spatial video capture available later year win round
im surprised people hyped spatial camera also wonder format recording able record video watch oculus quest 3d supported apple pro vision
youll need vision pro watch dont think blow affordable version vision pro
really curious plan combat porn apple vision pro know damn well people developing could even limit side loading looking likely wonder find way protect avp
didnt get watch presentation given arent two camera back spaced eyedistance apart im assuming theyre computationally im skeptical wont look uncanny artificial
huh
run political office virginia
price also come back uk 999 starting price 256gb pro 1099 bloody 1209 think iphone 13 pro started 949
honestly im shocked price pro pro max much cheaper expected compared everything else drastically increased price nice see apple increasing price
considering going get 256gb 15 pro max model anyway win
price increase usd least 50 increase cad 1699 256 1969 512 1749 2049 respectively
thats get ditching 128gb model lol 5g im fine cloud storage bit wasted make 200 upgrade max model instead 100
game showed fill 128gb model time 4k recording well base storage 256gb look fact iphone 15 pro max close almost feel like sell real choice make want standard 61 inch screen le battery 67 inch battery edit forgot 3x v 5x telephoto
also surprised apple reasonable
14 pro max worth 650 trade though
converted pro max 1591 europe thats mega difference ugh
wanted expect cost youll forgive reason okay raising price year later
euro price 100 cheaper
yes introduce iphone 16
rumor longest
new feature generally introduced pro model first
pressing button never going satisfying flipping ringer switch hope stay pro feature leaf regular lineup alone
expect feom apple
customizable button marketed revolutionary technology lol wish slide kept
well getting pro functionality like pink 15 standard bottom silent mode maybe get 15
mute button
also unable configure multiple action dumb
maybe accept youre buying top end phone youre getting every feature theyre gon na differentiate somehow
apple dopamine recepters simply burnt
except usbc thats everything else already using itd one le thing worry
didnt release mid cycle pro color last year
whatchu thinking forest green 13 mini almost made upgrade buying phone 1 year last everything stand didnt green still cool af tho knowledge havent seen burnt orange yet something like daytona orangehttpswwwcorvsportcomwpcontentuploads20201002b6affb828b215a24b52558fa229cfc11400x888jpg corvette could super cool suck phone like car everybody boring fuck blackwhitegrey sedan wish world color
rumoured scarlet red colour colour looked nice
green titanium would hit
didnt last year
wonder thats theyll drop gold time
id say good enough even older pro user im going 12 pro 15 plus ill get bigger screen get keep mostly feature 2x optical zoom main one
better getting 14pro instead
action button tho definitely need pro essential feature
yeah crazy much better phone got price stayed relatively im still rocking 8 past 6yrs cost amount iphone 15 think time upgrade
thats im gf wont care 120hz
bad spatial video even youre buying 3000 vision pro would nice possibly future putting cheaper oculus headset
clearance iphone 14 pro 120hz screen seems better 15 base unless im missing something
base model always good lack shiny camera
probably get 15 wife ill get 14 using 7 plus time pull trigger
planning hold onto 13 pro also unless really enticing trade offer upgraded iphone 7 13 pro best buy pay 150 similar offer come 15 pro might upgrade probably though trade bill credit component dont like
prob woulda got raked coal price increase next 0 update semi slid one pro max base 256 gb model making telephoto lens available pro max
aaaand anchored price mind already expensive price okay mind due raised expectation
thats actually kinda amazing considering rumor earlier annnd thats company spread fake rumor product
yeah im tempted upgrade 13 pro well im honest still run well usbc action button dynamic island better camera titanium finish etc arent enough justify cost point
right absolutely underwhelming preparring justify upgrading keynote doesnt look like anymore
paid monthly fee upgrade phone guess ill upgrade doesnt seem like anything fucking new
roughly 10 cheaper country previous model launch
funny every year always rumor starting price absolutely increase 100 every year theyve wrong far lol
tax american start talk reality pricesits insane ruled law eu getting fd fake price
non reason upgrade minimal change
actually lowered european price wasnt expecting granted mostly show insane starting thousand euro 14 chip 13 dynamic island
mind conditioning price cut instead
fail see whats exciting year iphone pro better camera better gaming thats didnt mention better battery life anything else thats new except titanium really doesnt matter much youre putting case around
thats carrier tradein deal usually restriction like staying x plan time period
carrier lock 36 month term decide upgrade year two youd lose remaining credit apple store give credit front
thats carrier trade value 1000
think carrier trade
extra added via bill credit carrier apple give credit front get monthly credit carrier next 24 month long maintain eligible rate plan
im hoping bestbuy good trade deal year 13 paid want upgrade 15 pro
sorry couldnt watch end whats new dynamic island
kinda wished theyd dare make action button orange smth
dynamic island dogtrash
starting 4999

let go titanium titanium pad runtime
watched official 4 minute advert youtube thought joke surprisingly lackluster
true dont even see upgrade
natural interesting one seems shift midgrey bronze green mixed
pastel 15 look pretty enticing
think last color confusing everyone supposed natural titanium color dark gray silver blue titanium color
think professional dont want showcase personality color dark purple green iphone 11 best color
look chang
im issue planning white initially couldnt even tell natural brown gray im starting lean towards natural im digging white much thought would seeing picture
never mention capacity say longer battery life compared previous iphones longer
apple never talked battery capacity
checked tech spec apple giving hour playback video music 14p
12 pro every year update vanilla need upgrade wife got 14 pro last year honeymoon phase dynamic island within couple hour
physic isnt accommodating ill take honestly
dont worry case absorbs bump flat level
considering annoying pump already kind wonder would pushback making entire phone thicker make flush camera fill space battery sell 96 hour battery life something
make rest phone thickness already give six pound iphone week long battery life
dont get samsung flagship camera good iphones camera bump anywhere near huge iphone apple seriously get called enough iphone 11 pro max ready upgrade last year obnoxious camera bump year get even bigger wtf
surprise
wish camera bump gone
periscope finally
someone doesnt care much camera quality really wish theyd model smaller camera flush back phone
never forget sierra baby blue
bad battery blow thinking upgrading
holding onto mine break
purps hit different
love purp skurp
love purple pro max
upgrade pro lineup get better color reason lol
green 11 pro stay heart always
sadly 120mm look really good bigger phone option
hate still incredibly fond memory x iphone year topoftheline everything without size
yeah thinking prefer smaller phone guess needed way justify buying beefier pro
physical limitation
seriously upgrade 14 pro 15 pro titanium case mean stronger thats lol
changed plus name max name iphone x max introduction told plus mean feature 6 6 7 8 plus better camera system difference size since x max would name max iphone 15 pro plus
mean missed part
size limitation rumour smaller 16 pro get 5x telephoto next year increase 63 inch accommodate 16 pro max also increase 69 inch
else distinguish buy pro want better camera selling point said hope new camera pro good samsung close
max pro
whats main difference aside 5x zoom
wait pro doesnt camera pro max
spend 4 nanosecond looking picture reduced 2inch square size
100 cheaper denmark last year pro max 256gb 12499 dkk year 11799 dkk
might currency related germany new 15 pro max 256gb price last year 14 pro max 128gb cheaper last year 256gb
aud succcccksss right
aussie dollar shit last year though hasnt
yeeeah pretty bad demo could least chosen pretty scene instead
showing game developed many month ago nothing developed iphone pro max like show big title devs claim got optimize game new hardware
ray tracing rtx rtx nvidia branding
least resident evil game looked nice plus death stranding next assassin creed releasing iphone never though would happen
lol
yes
sound like opted make physical dimension phone smaller rather significantly thinner bezel really hoping see ultra thin bezel need see comparison know sure
hop ni day trip could get 75 euro cheaper
im x finally ready move lol
people dont understand apple isnt really trying entice someone bought last year device much entice folk like havent upgraded awhile people buy device every year incremental upgrade complain split hair feel justified making purchase werent compelled make begin
oh exactly iphone 3gs iphone 5 android ever since going 15 pro max usbc
think hate people like subscription plan first year im feeling like ill get value add moving reference im 14pm spatial video cool sure clear 14 phone true 15 starting think hopping yearly upgrade wagon
yeah first iphone 10 year android im excited kinda disappointed model slightly better cool new feature whole thing going new good
people justify upgrading phone last year last last year 3 year ago thats fine day 1 buy really need hand 12pm replace previously handed 8 yep thing continues survive sixth year daily phone
might hop pixel 6 whose summertime performance pissing daily dont see future pixel getting better nearfuture however bought pixel frustrating month iphone 12 pretty bad camera lot apps surprisingly buggy hope lemon bad generation device reliable
fucking shit big upgrade youre apple forum like commenting high end car forum youre coming hyundai sonata exciting
iphone 11 really tempting get iphone 15 pro max use next 46 year battery change every 23 year really see iphone lasting way longer iphone 11
situation although im moving oneplus 7 pro longer champ oh camera terrible want dope picture video dog thats main reason
ive never owned iphone usb c last thing holding back trying
enjoy
going android apple long hiatus ive always samsung guy hate direction theyre going phone nonrounded corner useless spen etc new bud watch underwhelming
think intro usb c actually made feel practical imoi dont see lot iphone user live getting lightning cable hard disliked iphones proprietary stuff nice see droppedthanks eu commission might switch s20 fe pro
pixel 3xl finally rest
ive using android 5 year im going plunge get pro airpods watch
kind android
would anyone hate deciding buy phone reddit weird dont need reddits approval purchase anyone doesnt want thats fine also
im 12mini time move love size battery abysmal
still using android however really understand frustration especially seeing high end android action even samsung s22 problematic eg lag boot entering pin even incoming phone call ux
nothing hate held long welldue upgrade ask
opposite person want latest model every year social status justifies purchase amazing processor speed yet use phone social medium apple know
sure iphone able straight connect ssd card
got sued lol
sure thats case disappointing
actually wondering mean live photo thats case thats deal breaker never upgrade lol
48mp heif absolutely artificial edit wrong io 17 rc show 48mp heif heif max also available 14 pro
im satisfied long black dark blue though nothing thats clearly white gold pink interesting choice especially considering gold would probably sell gold watch milanese loop edit clearly white titanium model keynote basically never showed back device edge thought colour similar natural titanium
like darker boring im sure many want dark boring le dark boring
kind like lighter color tbh ive many greyblackslategunmetalmidnight phone
think natural titanium beautiful classic slightly golden thought would stuck color thankfully made easy choice
think apple also disappointed tbh barely showed except titanium gray
real cant pro ever get fun color
one loving blue
light gray gray dark gray blue gray much variety
texture dislike one hobby watch im fan titanium many reason clearly see apple facing watchmaker endured decade titanium annoying work consequence look grainy soft sharp edge
httpspreviewredditb736qzq1yvnb1jpegwidth1125formatpjpgautowebpsc3c7bb52a251720ea4e32d349835783270f6e43c see
wonder titanium harder color aluminum stainless steel
gunmetal
back plate titanium glass
people use case anyway
look like ryan murphy casting white guy brown hair cant tell difference
apple lol also surprised u colorful option like 5c first came
swear two version silver look exact
like natural titanium
wanted white silver anyway completely safe boredom hahahha
incredibly boring two color look nearly identical least promo photo perhaps something new material man wish apple would realize pro like color
grey dark gewy light grey blue
least thats consistent approach pro phone
15 plus boring
know case exist right
get natural probably anodize whatever color like
wow suck
slightly better battery life except audio playback reason according apple specshttpsiimgurcomeuixkhzpng always display action button night mode portrait due lidar sensor
honestly get pro solely pro motion significant difference maker imo
uhh reason pretty compelling 200 titanium 120hz better camera easily worth 200
potentially ram wont know teardowns rumor 6gb 15 8gb 15 pro edit oh also wifi 6e
120hz joke
thats point baseline model work 95 people like get
promotion make worth
thats pro phone always please dont forget prores external prores recording actually pretty crazy phone feature fit pretty perfectly pro moniker meaning pro user find value normal user nice best dont justify price increase
120hz reason enough lol
60 hz standard model hilarious point google pixel 5 3 year old upper mid range device 90 hz know get away yet lol
side button smaller bezel color
go standard 15 thread see feature everyone complaining
usb 30 speed 10gbps lmfaooo 10 year old technology
honestly people buy pro solely looking poor buying standard two lens
action button spatial better hdr video
listed reason im getting pro max plus biggest faster data transfer whats point prores take forever day transfer mac zoom lens promotion titanium neat keep phone case meh
oled display
pro record spatial video vision pro itll used may 5 people feature people saying needed taking spatial video make sense
heavier fatter marginally thinner bezel
pretty much got faster processor faster data speed transfer faster screen 100 excited phone
eh probably going upgrade iphone 11 iphone 15 pro iphone 15 pro 250 euro expensive iphone 15 going spent 1000 euro phone might well spent bit get best bit battery life always display 120hz third camera titanium seems worth upcharge
ive wanted 2 thing smaller pro version currently 14p pro max longer telephoto lens dont care titanium anything else wanted smaller lighter phone longer lens im annoyed want longer lens maintain large heavy phone
apparently 17 proi bet theyll standard a17 16 rtupscaling support
spatial video recording futureproof ar
youre trying hard negative youre iphone photography huge director rapper named cole bennett thats recently shooting video iphone example phone game changer youre mobile gaming entire country thats thing game changer plan vision pro enjoying spacial video game changer etc
8gb ram
120hz huge cant go back
processor way afster usbc data transfer speed way faster camera way better screenvariable refresh rate standard android phone 2020 overall two different generation phone practically
said added new lens coating cut
iphone 15 pro max 1tb 1979 netherlandsthats 2120
999 uk tranlates 1247 usd
price germany got cheaper 100
least price europe went thats probably euro went bit thank god
85 expensive switzerland bad thats 70 le last year model
canada pro 50 higher
yes country price suck
yeah switzerland got cheaper lol 1079 chf base 15 pro 1189 chf last year think
yup base pro version live 1630
technically state state sale tax nh de
yeah even le uk part europe lol
15 pro max lighter 13 pro
im wondering one buy two find hard justify paying twice money 15 pro might look 14 pro moment
usbc titanium
13 pro perfect iphone imo think hold another year unless phone feeling sluggish 2 cent
5x look bit rough tbh pretty useful tool experience use 3x lot im sure would want go back 2x 15 pro
action button instaset camera parent young kid
talk battery life improvement 14 pro 14 pro max
get new battery
guess always difficult give realistic battery life expectation 13 pro last well day use thats probably use differently itd great measured battery life something absolute like screen time similar degradation seems really inconsistent different phone even similar use case
14 pro let tell ive disappointed previous 11 pro performing much better battery wise even 2 year use 15 might slightly better given new chip dont expect anything impressive current one
really like zoom much photography great tool reading tiny text distance
dont forget battery life
battery life larger screen 200 lens
test taking 2x3x zoom think make landscape photo better make mountain bigger etc based lens work known thing prefer taking 3x photo others dont lens main camera distorts basically reason dlsr camera take portrait 50mm lens natural look
think well worth use concert choice new camera quality might good enough use daily life
non pro last gen a16 began b last year 13 13 pro a15 bionic cpu
also get 256gb space get standard size pro would cost additional 100 storage tier pm 100 13 pro really like standard size think im going bite bullet go 256 standard size
try remind im trying take pic something thats still always move closer instead zooming might work situation maybe enough pay new phone
yeah im kinda shocked best color keep second guessing natural titanium almost boring black maybe thats bc see time road bike
use case
wasnt lossless audio already possible 20 certainly isnt date rate issue
using apple dongle wired headphone still spilound fine
pretty much thats really since iphone x 12 5g 14 dynamic island
pretty much thats phone past 5 year incremental refinement rather big change said operating system
really iphone 12
mean reality case last 4 5 year imagine case going forward im sure many people expect otherwise dont think bad thing either
didnt actually raise price removed 128gb tier
price raised outside u
thing bill credit instant discount upgraded year ago wont able upgrade iphone 18 without losing year worth credit betting upgrading plus locking customer worth even im apple trade adding boost mobile plan 25month unlimited everything save way locked 90 plan 3 year
giving decent amount even iphone 13 pro max ill preordering immediately friday
yeah im dumb commenting comment wanted add milk system basically get phone free picked secondhand iphone facebook marketplace going trade att 1000 im going sell phone privately get back pay pay

seems 15 pro missing 5x lens 15 pro max wonder one instead 3x couldnt find anything mentioned tech site yet presentation didnt make super clear
15 pro max add 135mm lens otherwise 15 pro focal length
im pretty sure cropping picture 24mm 35mm convenience anything definitely going miss 52mm x compression nice dont think 2x mode going
also say longer need switch portrait mode yet portrait mode still
ultra
im annoyed truck carry thing sedan
pretty unfortunate say larger body allows larger component presume
difference spec make seem like exactly edit see 5x lens instead 3x
wait mustve missed
hear right actually removed macro pro eta anyone else wondering specshttpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs say camera macro weird way tried make sound like macro unique pro max presentation though
case samsung phone year apple didnt bother periscope lens take lot room understandable
ive got 11 pro really wanted justify upgrade look milquetoast dont see reason
lol thats cool plenty usbc alone huge many u
yep another year 12 pro didnt need drop killer feature im spending 1300 upgrade
mean biggest thing weigh new feature weight bad
first time watching keynote live cause eager get upgrade 12pro due poor battery life kinda debatable
feature would even
wife x im running 12 pro think im going get 15 pro max give 12 pro seems like better trade
11 pro planning upgrading year really seeing reason still
thats actually brilliants iphone marketing year someone say couple year upgrade buy new iphone newer feature apple isnt dependent people recently bought recent previous iphone people still rocking old gen either way buying iphone infinite loop inside apple buying scheme
thinking switch 12 pro periscope camera find max yeah miss even larger heavier phone
12 pro max gon na get 15 pro max know debating lol
im unclear want upgrade 13 pro max upgrading girlfriend 12 mini though
use 120hz display week youll never want touch 12 pro
im feeling exact way maybe next year
still rocking 6 plus
120hz refresh rate alone worth upgrade opinion battery life
12pro might wait 14pros go discount purple lol
id keep 12 pro max another year werent abysmal battery life 128 gb storage
normal iphone colour hideous opinion titanium white grey interesting would wanted silver pas year
idk could pull 20w think would mentioned
spec page old phone 50 charge 35 minute 20w adapter higher
350 kw 800v porsche charger
fan size pro max cant argue price point 100 iphone 15 pro 256gb guess itll take time getting used
im sulfide really wonder look like
someone make software id image
work taking picture home wifi network
small iteration 10 year major new tech revealed
lowered price everything switzerland year 999 include tax theyre actually cheaper u point 1079 including tax
10x compared ultrawide 5x compared normal white standard apple marketing
apparently charging speed still 25 w
thats great phone
upgraded black 14 pro yesterday 30 day returnexchange policy 15 pro wow thought would ive seen trade far though happy 14 pro came sierra blue 13 pro max
thought entire point forcing usbc could use existing cable use device instead relying box also guess universal power important consideration anyways
think thats pretty standard phone people arent gon na use
mac charging cable mean use cable reason buy apple one want use usb3
people already using apple shortcut let shoot 48mp pro raw auto convert 48mp heif auto delete raw thats something really want
48 mp heif available 14 pro io 17
third party camera apps already shoot 48mp heic jpeg
ever different expecting massive change yoy
dont think really need upgrade 14 pro max honestly lol
main wide camera main sensor 15pm identical 14pm change telephoto lens sensor
15pm 8 lighter weight thats one thing ill appreciate
uk 256gb 15 pro max 110 cheaper 256gb 14 pro max nice
wait info appear gsmarena
friday
dont imagine ray tracing going impressive itll beautiful unusable mediocre smooth like ps5
yes open new account verizon att tmobile postpaid instore
bland classy generally
pro record usb c hd dont mind carrying around
im actually thinking way granted aligned birthday want treat always display titanium frame dynamic island smaller bezel brighter screen 48mp camera usbc 2 year worth update seems sweet spot nowadays iphones also hate heavy 13pm lmao
upgrade 13 pm
think foldable innovative damn thats
yearly upgrade
huge upgrade imo pro doesnt justify price difference
8 plus upgraded 14 pro difference massive moment start using notice slow old phone
physic greater zoom mean need space smaller phone simply doesnt space
main camera basically identical shooting pro raw telephoto 5x instead 3x pro max thats major change
blue
coating 95 titanium aluminium band effectively titanium alloy
titanium pretty horrific compared aluminum anyway thermal conductivity im guessing use aluminum inside heat dissipation kinda hinted keynote
say far could see aluminum talked internal structure phone stainless steel either
said thought context chassis internals screen
shall see resistance scratch drop give u coming week doubt strong presented due bonding process
key thing somewhat turn 15 pro line true expecting unibody casing aluminum phone titanium jacket
cant wait someone strength test see crumple couldnt even use solid titanium body apple really dropping ball release
itll probably help retain price though someone doesnt use case phone biggest degradation phone little nick get edge aluminum normal wear tear noticeable cant say hasnt real world usage yet theory think titanium cut
titanium exotic pain weld machine got whole bike made plus good suspension fork drivetrain decent wheel etc 2000 2020 name brand one still
apparently
always people able willing upgrade yearly apple would crazy say thanks money lol plus everyone upgrade cycle people go every 2 year every 3 way new model anyone buy year
brightness 14 pro 2k nit ram unknown probably 68gb battery last year know exact amount wifi 6e
mean yeah literally reason buy new iphone yearly anymore
need wireless charging option plastic
never use mute switch mute 99 time
map action button mute though
idk man use switch like month lol could use functionality
brother literally default action mute switch lmao settle lost nothing gained lot
havent touched two year
android fanboys lost sub hating lmao
presumably controlling thing like light switch directly phone via threadthread itll faster
guess skip wifi talk directly home hub connection good
great ultra
tradein apple always joke never tradein somewhat current device
a17 new usb chip built non pro model use last year a16 doesnt
legislation never court case eu wasnt targeting specific business entity creating new law apply everyone jurisdiction basic function government apple publicly committed supporting lightning iphone decade back 2012 timing eu action really coincidental
people already charge cord nightmare due device use usb c moving towards single standard nice
cant
use airpods year
using smart globe carrier
dont even need adapter standard ac cable
yes
use random standard usbc usba cable
wouldnt mean phone dimension shrinking
shrink chassis phone
yes thinner bezel screen size overall dimension pro model smaller
said thinner bezel also changed dimension entire phone without changing size screen phone whole slightly smaller
yes thinnest yet
speed 14 pro 20w httpswwwapplecomcaiphonecomparemodellistiphone15promaxiphone14promaxiphone15pro
im boat seem use 3x 5x
phone boat phone still useable fence upgrading
everyone worst take
would say improved way really matter like 48mp sensor 3x zoom
price lowered 100
cant leave comment like expand upon
exactly lol
wait
hundred available sale amazon
pick dirt cheap anywhere
dont buy apple cable get thing lot cheaper elsewhere
get carlinkit turn wireless bluetooth
wouldnt say horrible
really upgrading 14pm 13 pro miss 61 screen size importantly weight
save backup current phone get new phone transfer backup
new m3 since based a17
yes mean next 16 get chip le gpu core
okay thank
telephoto would talking zoom lens phone iphone 15 pro 3x optical zoom 15 pro max 5x optical zoom really determine something want
wont fit made phone slightly smaller action button replaces mute switch apple usually switch thing around enough previous year case dont work
color four option including black titanium white titanium blue titanium natural titanium
hand video showing thinner bezel
pro max model get telephoto zoom lens year
usually use second wind boost sale expect see around february
think good time upgrade x im currently
15 pro max obvious choice
current con screen tad bit small go pro max
unless new portrait using two camera depth information like 3d video
upgrade regular size 15 pro itll ton lighter thats youre looking
hold thats im
one year wait worth see iphone 16 ultra model major battery bump according rumor periscope lense cherry cake
dont tempt good time
beat meat
new titanium body almost stiff dakota johnson acting
yes natural titanium silver color
silver colour natural titanium colour natural titanium faint bronzeyellow tint
didnt mention added sort coating titanium surface might actually matter much could worth watching
lol yeah im probably getting 15 plus pro max pink
ive always hated pro line doesnt get colorful option
literally close zero difference base pro year dumb
guess getting color titanium challenge hopefully next year something fun interesting
still ipad pro frustrating
dont understand google doesnt market exact point every time iphone fitzes inopportune moment gall open camera navigating feel like commercial android 3x ram
huge itll give way better multitasking hopefully save multiple item clipboard
need brain ram lol
apps closing dependent app ram
main reason switching 11 pro app refreshing pain
ill give guy wife spatial
edit dammit dont even try pretend accidental lol
like labotomy
ill give wife spatial pal
yeah fear going feature enjoyed 47 people afford vision pro
rparallelview become popular one export photosvideos stereogram depth might little shallow thoughas 2 camera us arent far apart imagine future iteration iphone camera top corner phone better mimic distance human eye
spatial video even bigger file size max storage capacity time dont want pita transfer via cable hicapacity icloud subscription tier
lol dude software based course playable apple vision whatever called im sorry think funny people even think remote possibility play video non apple vr device lol
come onits apple course apple pro vision
bit missed opportunity make viewable iphone ipad though even slight movement following angle phone give depth
wonder many year take
based apple naming scheme gon na apple vision vision plus bigger size pro get apple vision pro max outdoor version vision ultra see vision mini vision se
though make think old 360 degree camera android used probably still offer took 360 photo theyd fun review phone vr setup revisited photo stunning instant regret using 360 feature previously
wish would add something like tilt control video player iphone could watch 2d still get perspective moving phone around something
unless someone figure use video data underneath oculus something
doubt people dont even go 1tb iphone guarantee sell one bit le sell
need combat though already common law place digital content people legally view film content current phone tablet laptop etc vision pro would require different restriction elevated moderation compared device appenabled device generally dont support pornspecific apps app store dont selectively block user viewing medium site user view
certainly plausible initial iteration spatial video capture look wonky crisp resolution also since one involved lens isnt main especially physical caveat youve raised theyll need artificially adjust probably mainly trying claim firsties keep hype vision pro reminder make consumer feel like theyre bonus future proofing ability
didnt mention presentation 100 expect lidar sensor providing additional depth data
pro phone theyre releasing feature capture spatial video 3d video announcement said feature released later year
15 15 plus 50 cheaper im actually impressed pulled price rather making new normal
wow seriously 999 confirmed thats 150 le 14 pro
surprisingly watch ultra 2 also got cheaper europe germany 100 eur le 899 eur instead 999 eur
think
want put conspiracy hat say people expected based rumor would 100 dollar normal maybe apple said certain people reveal leaker
think theyve already completed price hike honest ill take
probably already raised price year ago
please careful word complain otherwise next year see increase
live expensive current generation unfortunately
yeah messed last time getting 128 im glad forcing make mistake lol
advisable get 512 gb year
interesting price went uk 100 le pro 50 le base model
im sure increase holy hell pro max expensive live translate usd would 1620 baseline model dont feel price justice currency gotten devalued lately everything else become expensive rampant inflation would say akin 1800 baseline model top one something like 2600 decent amazing job marketing would probably land whats comfortably middle class scandinavian country base model pro max honestly almost 23 monthly salary income tax whew
mean isnt price last year 256 model
going trickle feature like dynamic island
think youre going love
tactic push people pro model
guy planned obsolescentses
theyre definitely looking differentiate two tier feel like theyre somewhat running reason presumably stopped putting new processor nonpro amount time theyve spent titanium bit funny especially 98 people case
lmaoo
feature
good click good haptics could pretty satisfying
yeah nickel diming bullshit much brand
picture show switch
must
yeah dont get wrong pleased see usb c smaller bezel battery however wait year
nope yellow 14 14 plus
forest green wish theyd release every year
honestly always case phone base color doesnt really matter phone without case way slippery hand
someone sell apple shit always disappoints ask customer color want theyre like space gray well obviously dont want pink one thats fruity like fine boring tell insecure man without telling
would sell pixel 7 pro immediately daytona orange option
forest green mini killing small loved color idea easy slip pocket man big finger cant type thing giving color 15 going suck
knowing luck im gon na get natural titanium theyll bring back gold midcycle color
think possibly incentivize people buy case color want
thinking also taking consideration going 14 pro max basically 15 pro plus pro motion 3x optical zoom minus 2000 nit peak brightness
promotion thats getting got girlfriend 13 mini love thing also see stutter time
15 pro 120hz sceen promotion would noticeable difference
11 pro max 15 good whats difference 15 pro max 15 plus
im going base iphone 7 15 plus gon na grand lol
optical zoom
except optical zoom
im seriously considering action button usb c important def going 14 pro
get 15 keep 14 deserve
hello wife
think consider keeping everyone 15 everyone switch different cable would annoying sure
bro get 15 lol tf
really amazing considering state mobile phone market increasing price would decide pro sale
definitely shame 999 great starting price highend phone thats state world rn
999 standard price flagship smartphone like 56 year
eh point 12 pro lasted 3 year absolutely wrecked fault got cheap case rip 1 day smartphone every billionaire us aint bad deal 15 pro assuming take care im sure easily last 4 year get battery replacement probably 5
want aaaand thats post need work hanging aaaaannd annnnnd sound weird
thought vision pro heard 2000 rumor turned real thing even expensive lol
trade value applies carrier deal afaik apple definitely offer le trade go
thats certain carrier deal att prepaid none apply apple offering 360 12 pro tradein
though trade 13 pro 15 pro cost 550
aww even added lmao right laugh
offering 580 pm decent 2 yo phone 11
rconfidentlyincorrect
carrier trade go live dont see att
really hope get least 800 tradein deal dont either wont getting 15 ill switching samsung
tmobile providerthat give credit 24 month regardless im trading iphone xr purchased 10 buying 15 outright using boost mobile deal shit big carrier tmobile 90month unlimited everything pay 25month unlimited everything tower att tower amount ill save monthly well worth trade credit carrier
apple give le dent corner though wont front back glass fine corner small dent drop
tmobile 24 use tmobile carrier 24 13
base model pro exclusive anymore
97 people going cover case
overhyped literally notch line pixel top
buy usb 3 cable
buy usbc usb 3 cable work probably rumor theyd try limit mfi accessory really doubt theyre true apple charge suspect itll nice new braided cable least shortage cable 20 optional ship chargeonly cable device use usbc annoying part usbc spec thing even exist
aint nonway
good thing im professional video editor dozen usbc cable
honestly id surprised even 1 iphone 15 pro user ever use cable data transfer probably like 01
bruh cable
nope base 15 usb20
regular iphone 15 still usb 20 us old a16 chip designed usb 20 speed lightning usb 30 exclusive feature pro phone since us a17 pro chip lol
actually usb 32 usb 30 officially longer exists
need save something next iphone
useless even miniscule price difference probably wouldnt worth transfer entire content 1tb iphone usb 32 gen 2 le 15 minute 256gb model le 4 minute realistically often 999 customer going
said larger compared 14 pro httpspreviewreddittmha01afbvnb1pngwidth2525formatpngautowebps38c757586cd81a745284a400a805e177a7ab678a
telephoto sensor main camera sensor identical iphone 14 pro im disappointed release improvement telephoto lens thats
damn youre still 100 im 93
yeah 13pm trade 15pm usb c alone easy
sheep
price another year winning iup
little titanium pry bar natural gray iphone match color pry bar oh man beautiful color imo plus feel titanium different metal idk explain love even feel cooler temp im excited phone lol
funny hate pastel compared forest green vibrant blue recent phone look cookie cutter
im partial pro color base one base least offer variety could released pro one offered color id happy seem basically anyway
natural look gold sand hoping light gray edit look much better real photo video
look existing ultra watch natural titanium colour like brushed aluminum slight warm hue
love natural titanium look like prop straight dune taupe finewoven case going full dystopian
correct still look identical silver eye even leaned towards screen laptop trying discern difference im sure couldnt
even say time
physic would accomodate slightly thicker phone bigger battery
ill take flat phone without camera back
dumb enough believe physic prevents making phone camera bump
number one reason use case camera arent hitting table
unless know dont like people go naked
ive wondering point titanium casing ive heard supposed eliminate need case camera still exposed
would likely ridiculously heavy think switch titanium effort make lighter heavier
yes please
ultra 1499
going way back brick phone better interface touch screen
little surprised havent come apple ultra 3 day battery life phone outdoor adventure extended battery big ol turtle shell backed phone
put shittier smaller camera dont care feature dont work anyway picture look like shit regardless
im exact boat guess im order replacement battery screen 11 pro bring spend 1000 something hideously designed hoping theyd move periscopic lens nope weird see apple supposed company pride beautiful hardware design nobody find ginormous camera module beautiful
yup favourite colour iphone currently iphone 13 pro max morning assuming going get iphone 15 pro cycle im sure feature worth colour arent inspiring
fan pacific blue im happy new titanium blue
mine 88
ill saving maybe upgrade worthwhile feel difference
agreed im pretty pissed id love enough pay lug around bigger phone
cant justify phone large
main difference larger 5x zoom pro max anything else
wish could get high end iphone model size iphone 5 hate trend huge phone
pro big pro max question
im pretty certain 11 pro feature 11 pro max
x 11 pro 13 pro 14 pro max version lol
im still rocking x size bigger phone hard pressed fit front pocket
lighter importantly also easier repair v 14
usb c definitely upgrade
pro max get periscope camera
pro max 5x lens pro 3x lens physical limitation smaller phone cant fit larger lens
thought pro pro max camera
yeah hear rumor phone year away released 69 model replacing apple logo simply nice
im talking pro pro max
way massive
actually pretty scene probably wouldnt run 30fps lol good reason nvidia rtx gpus need 200 watt power
listen youre sitting complaining rtx phone like damn winning yall
personally im ok making physical phone bit smaller aka shrinking bezel im happy pm size right
phone ever slightly smaller check compare model page apple website
im also upgrading im x max honestly would consider waiting another year lackluster announcement im storage space thing bit sluggish im sure camera update nice least
x long time okay switch even tradeins favor
gon na upgrade 15 pro max 20xx rate
x single reason get new one aside wanting bit change lol
x dont give go screen notch coward
kinda wish id held onto x bit longer traded soon battery deteriorated instead replacing
upgrading xr
im still 7 plus lol guess finally time upgrade
thing xr slow cant bear anymore think got money worth
day 1 buy first time ever ill preorder one currently 12 pro max last leg hate update apps close whenever
thats good run
man miss x perfect iphone imo somehow feel like camera better camera 13 pro least constantly shifting lens werent issue x
didnt say old phone
subscription plan still work fine two year interval though
well better camera usbc better gpu still revolutionary 14
14 pro good make one look mediocre
actually true 15pro phone a17 3nm chipissue apple downplayed reason unknownit improve performance battery overall processing speedsbut apple didnt talk much
dont understand 12pm go wave absolute nonexistent performance point typing character take moment load people use 8 baffle
change battery keep using 11
currently galaxy s20 fe still solid phone battery doesnt hold good anymore wont getting anymore software update gon na take opportunity jump ship
upgrade program zero financial incentive hold current phone unless either price increased plan holding phone 2 year
quite explicit keynote
didnt though get sued every day nothing going usbc
ive always hated live photo lol
wouldnt call black
make sense ive seen whole phone im sure keynote explained natural silver option looked identical
almost always go black dark grey phone like blue lot
adult contemporary gon na listen steely dan raw titanium iphone
pro color btw
14 pro purple beautiful
pro gotten nice color every year year
might colorblind
dont know much actual alloy used titanium anodized pretty wide range colorshttpwwwpersonalumichedubobdentitaniumspectrumweb2jpg
nope way easier drop titanium solution depending electrical charge put get basically colour see put oil water
reminded old htc one m8 man thing still beaut
lidar
disable always display would drive kinda nut
always 14
battery life look exactly 14pm
15 120hz would upgrade rather 15 pro
promotion 67in screen issue doesnt seem much upgrade current 13 pro max usbc really biggest selling point mild one considering airpods apple tv remote still need lightning 580 tradein value help push towards upgrade though brand new phone half cost
first time use 120hz display instantly realize never use 60hz display
right best reason downgrade 200 12 month extra 17ish month le keep 2 year thats like 2 coffeecookie visit month
asked apple support said iphone 15 model 6gb ram iphone 15 pro model 12gb ram lol think mustve smokin something looked spec pro
people dont realize big difference 120hz lol returned ipad air solely 60hz giving aneurism compared 120hz iphone 13 pro max
big thing crazy apple still keeping away base model 300 android support
external prores recording missed got info like mount external ssd record prores
one first mobile device support 120hz actually ipad pro 2017
normal iphone never 3 camera lens
confirmed big reason im still holding 6 plus
2400 usd india
someone u bring phone
completely different phone though pro 999 usd u 1229 eur including tax
apple show u price tax different different state
fell 100 least thats nice surprise although due exchange rate improved
u price dont include tax
20 vat thats u price always without tax
honestly nice surprise
case size matter
wrong 15 pro max 221 g iphone 13 pro 204 g
let real eu apple would still lightning port use wirless charging pretty irrelevant
yup see thats bad
3 nm shouldve gotten longer battery wonder us
thats true le wasteful ill see incentive trade well
use im trying take picture something far away thing 3x zoom much quality made worse additional storage use pro 4k 5x optical zoom also provide better quality thats im probably going pro max
still look really good
never understand people putting phone case buying opinion amazing looking high quality phone put cheap ugly looking case dont even careful cant count often dropped iphone floor nothing happened
yes lossless super easy even 20 even uncompressed 16441 lpcm something like 15 megabit bitrate enough mathematically perfect audio
100 cheaper europe
100 cheaper uk
spain cheaper lol
false went 100
yeah ive att 20 year im ever changing point ive got bill set 37 12 dollar per person thats unlimited everything real reason change plus best coverage state get im getting full credit im also paying full price outofpocket phone either paid 33 cash towards cost phone ive used last year
ebay fee used sell iphone get 200300 offer however ebays fee eats majority profit
much giving 13 pro max
trade credit use national carrier sorry realize everyone definitely lot folk using one national carrier plan would giving 1000 credit phone paid 1000 kept phone year would literally zero dollar
u majority market share
3x httpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs
yes 3x httpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs
pro 3x pro max 5x
dont believe find info missed part keynote idk anything camera besides 5x ultra well thanks lol 135mm ultra well
really underwhelming improvement neat trick prism marginally better zoom distance still close enough solid argument made 3x useful daytoday thing arent close enough good picture 3x still going far 5x 5x going force back want telephoto shot yknow either way lame still dont periscope lens
mistake max pro
apple pr team arrived
girl bye
iphone x top feature normal size
thats reasoning every time happened past magically find way fit pro next year clearly strategic get customer go pro max
5x zoom
11 pro gang im gon na get new battery like new
ive got 11 pro im fucking stoked finally upgrade thing really slowed last year battery still 80
11 pro screenfaceid broken im definitely upgrading also addition promotion magsafe usbc higherres camera add worthwhile upgrade imo even phone wasnt broken
id trade 11 pro sooner later trade credit lol boat last year saw att deal gave like 9001000 trade credit got 14 pro 224month lol tempted take deal every year every
honestly iphone 11 always hot charge atleast two three time day despite changed battery month ago
ive got 11 pro really wanted justify upgrade look milquetoast dont see reason thats actually brilliants iphone marketing year someone say couple year upgrade buy new iphone newer feature apple isnt dependent people recently bought recent previous iphone people still rocking old gen either way buying iphone infinite loop inside apple buying scheme
12 introduced lidar 13 added 120hz dropped notch island 14 made dynamic really 11 last round edged model 12 onwards switched current hard edge also 120hz
x really feel like 15 pro max upgrade well worth
would upgrade usbc
well considering get hefty trade value like 600 upgrade even willing sell privately
ill happily wait next design refresh still love 12
exactly first iphone 13 pro hand friend one negatively surprised heavy really positive point weigh exactly
well 12 pro first gen 5g thats always expected bad battery live still went im upgrading reason alone test support battery life better dynamic island zoom weight higher display brightness usbc
new design
hmm yeah place noticed slowdown im loving lately could probably wait 1 year sure
magsafe probably biggest thing
thats actually brilliants iphone marketing year someone say couple year upgrade buy new iphone newer feature apple isnt dependent people recently bought recent previous iphone people still rocking old gen either way buying iphone infinite loop inside apple buying scheme
also hoping bigger change
back glass shattered though justify upgrade right
thank think pastel must polarizing
look samsung t5 t7 creditcard size ssd drive easily stick one rear phone use small usbc cable record directly 2tb ssd even bigger go macpc connect ssd usbc transfer file editing videomakers huge reason bought 12 pro max time shot practical stuff like storagetransferring made hassle seems fix lot
ca 79 percent sale tax
existing usb c setup work iphone 15 phone limiting speed usb 2 nothing boost even apple charger
yes thats still true included cable probably hopefully work usbc device usbc nothing connector shape anywhere usb 20 speed usb 4 also used display connection thunderbolt
pretty sure proraw way turn smarthdr garbage shoot 48mp heif itll
would use halide
yeah get shortcut thing done honestly pain time glad built option
link shortcut like one found crashed deleting lot duplicate
saw awesome seriously doubtful upgrade beta one pointed
yes aware thanks response
one
everyone hoping periscope zoom lens 10x
wasnt really expecting huge difference come
true macro mode thing much different
let get crazy real world make little difference comparison 781 ounce 221g 15pm v 847 ounce 240g 14pm 19g difference put perspective clear apple 14pm case 34g
thank
understand order friday im asking pre save fill information checkout friday like several year havent seen today
sweet seemed confusing store app maybe ill store
14pm switched android fine phone id prefer usbc seeing allll device use
real thats sold 256gb
yeah huge feature record lot video
treat king 14 pm kind regret bit large im debating trade 15 pro id get normal 15 pro motion
honestly even smaller 14 pro pretty heavy im really looking forward lighter weight issue recent pro phone
fair point 2 year appears sweet spot term resale value go find 13 pro max heavy remember holding first time thinking chucky boy lol
also 13pm didnt choose drown front camera 11p 25 year 470 apr employee couldnt excuse minor upgrade smaller lighter 15p could basically 300 resell
iphone x
honestly apple stagnation space prolonged foldable would innovative know want bigger experience need ipad personally id like something like samsung dex iphone able turn desktoplaptop replacement like one device rule kind thing samsung work phone great able plug monitor desktop experience think would incredible apple could triple sensor size imagery bring close full frame lot challenge would love carry around dslr could get amazing imagery thats light year ahead competition far im concerned iterative feel like 8 year id love see innovation
take care screen though want use 14pm without case last time got scratch screen put front side desk moved
thanks alot im glad brightness staying 2k nit already bright enough itll help heat battery life glad hear wifi 6e doubt therell ram increase since getting storage increase essentially extra cost compared last year battery little better thanks 3 nm chip a17 along titanium usb c extra storage thinner bezel action button 35 watt charging speed actually great set upgrade impressed
good thing
oh yea forgot
fact default mapping
complain instead
value seeing phone mute lying table feeling one packet change minimum make former useless latter take longer one need cycle check mute pocket big step u use switch acknowledge people use apple watch dont use switch could find use button task
use accidentally get toggled unmute
make sense android phone mute switch
also wider coverage meshing dont need extend wifi cover whole property node route edge case like pretty handy lot rebar wall
youre telling a16 isnt capable data transfer faster usb2 protocol would mean smartphone whole limited bus size would bottlenecked
airpods charger came airpods also belkin 3in1 stand charge often im sure people would would rare id caught needing charge even rarer id happen usbc lightning cord never get caught dead iphone battery
1mm dimension
wish would kept dimension made screen bit bigger
ahhh make sense thank
mean screen protector made 14 series compatible 15 series
mine great shape still case screen cover ill probably wait see tmobile offer
yes within iphone lineup compared android phone pro seems bit overrated
well kinda 1200 last year get increased storage
yes ton available amazon third party cable really unreliable come carplay sometimes disconnect unplug plug multiple time make work youre using apple work flawlessly reason
tried didnt play nice hotspot trying share data
two issue 1 wireless carplay lag significantly compared wired 2 wireless carplay absolutely destroys battery
personal taste guess whole brushed metal thing look grungy horrible nothing sleek high end device
lot lighter though
backup save photo data current phone used 127128 gb
pro model doesnt get 5x telephoto typical apple wanted lighter weight phone dont want give feature im already spending 1k phone
basic premise original portrait mode last year iphones many camera year
dad get reddit im trying use phone
nice job bud almost
look like tinge brown screenshots guess would call warm silver dig color suck think natural pair well evergreen case
natural silver titanium color
except side button think big difference camera
etiquette
hope thats case theyve able put color onto stainless steel still chose put single fun color onto stainless feel iphones understand pvd titanium also pretty common thing im sure many limitation color achieved process
even 8gbs ram nooo
exactly look camera like guy seeing wasted marketing opportunity tbh
yo clipboard would awesome
wait iphone clipboard like one window
need sort pie sky thinking multi item clipboard sort technology surely cant adapted phone
hahaha im overdue upgrade
okay remember last time app randomly closed macbook mind much larger apps often many open randomly get kicked memory thing window heck 4gb ram window could hold much would slow significantly least wasnt losing progress tweet typing message responding think acceptable happen smartphone device people use laptop
yet many people dont even notice left 11 pro max well still isnt good enough currently available iphones
reminded favorite cursed comment ever also choose guy dead wifehttpswwwredditcomraskredditcomments5c79n0commentd9uf56l edit nsfw topic
shes big fan double spatials use alt though lol
get best spatial ill help fill empty space
handle 3d
amazing
came say
setting future 10 year vision pro evolves pair glass youll able watch vids idea lidar sensor
even able afford vision pro able thinking worth money 2nd gencheaper version actually 1500 think itll much easier sell
tbh far affording concerned majority people especially financing wont make sense everyone obviously anyone want seriously consider buying one likely
dozen u dozen
think software headset magically generate data encoded somewhere file lmao
hopefully thats pipeline im sure itll look least slightly different maybe hint towards 2024 device screen capability
would say least 5
apple would appreciate association pretty much obvious
problem wouldnt resolution would artifact ai trying figure go let say use left hand lens video left eye apple vision pro need feed video right eye cant use right lens iphone since far enough apart scale everything look way use ai try shift image right involves guesswork lens literally isnt correct location 3d space youll assume thing would look like different angle
additional depth data wont help fact dont different optical perspective centimeter apart
oh meh feature imo dont think 3d super big
theyve done seems like continue fluctuate depending strength local currency
say apple website
mean leaker never 100 percent correct anyway
illegal sell 64gb iphone regret every single day
mean go setting app check much storage currently using personally im even hitting 128gb actually used storage probably wont step keep mind photo taken new phone significantly larger due increased resolution
seems like uk vat 20 iphone effectively 1040 usd vat 4 expensive u counting vat
obviously said someone normally wouldve bought 128gb version spend 100 would want pro max
dont need storage
yes dont sell 128gb model user pay 100 extra something dont benefit
fair apple adopted dynamic island nonpro iphones quite quickly fully expecting see notch iphone 15 guess surprise
wish would trickle 120hz display edit yes well aware promotion wont come base model anytime soon doesnt make le b though
want apps make use trickling nonpro year later way go although honestly shouldve done last year
make sense pro model live one year normal model live 23 year new feature doesnt get uptake expect lock normal model year
fun call lonely island
cant innovate anymore clear thats grawlixhttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarygrawlix say want
like piss proletariat
well see still exclusive apple watch ultra
alpine green sierra blue best iphone color ever
id anything pink pro pro max
plus finally get another cool blue phone
im 12 pro max thinking 14 pro max usually heavily discount previous pro max move left stock im canada dont know beeping difference 14 pro max 15 plusor maybe 15 pro max dont think could go back smaller screen
im slightly glad 12 pro doesnt wont miss dont
every pro since 13 promotion
seconded wtf lol
nah honest im stage life dont really care smartphones anymore use reddit taking picture sending message occasionally listening spotify want new one guarantee apps wont slow anymore lol
spoken like someone doesnt love wife get 14 get new exciting phone wouldnt want youre still getting huge upgrade
nah giving partner new one easy w come
nah lightning cable spare problem u right
thats price since 2017 amazing hasnt moved
mean big deal phone making meaningful update year year id go 12 year upgrade theyre expensive incremental spend amount per year phone go least 4 year update honest im really split whether enough new stuff 11 pro 15 pro justify upgrade far tell mostly phone term daytoday use case
considering much inflation running rampant past year price actually seems cheap compared iphone x launch 2017 6 year ago
rumor 2000 3000 common value rumor almost never overestimate price substantial amount
yeah im hoping att offer good deal coming
correct already checked apple offer upto 650 website said 1000 carrier deal tell go check website
100 checked apple site see offered 400 13 pro
figured havent updated language used made seem like apple
httpswwwapplecomshopbuyiphonecarrieroffers
worth 13 pro max think worth trade girlfriend 12 mini 200 front v 200 front 600 36 month ill still come ahead regardless
take apple store ive noticed employee barely care v third party trade company
doesnt make le useless
maybe dynamic island wont forgotten feature anymore sound like support halfassed even useful anyone
case used leave cutout toggle button likely covered like rest
equivalent touch bar soon trashed
yeah cant brag super luxury 50 apple cable
anker friend
shouldnt need shell extra get full usb speed 1k phone
apple block using software
chargeonly cable really usb 20 come usb letter signifies shape connector usb supported usb 102030 usb c support technology well except maybe 10 idk im expert may confusing necessary keep cost otherwise manufacturer would need make 50 thunderbolt 4 cable find cheap usb c charging cable 10
one glad chargeonly cable exist
make doubt theyd limit data speed nonmfi could place real world bet throttling 3rd party cable would seems onbrand apple lately
thats thunderbolt 4 cable wayyy faster usb 3
thunderbolt 4 usb c usb 30
overpriced thunderbolt usb 30
right angry
thats thunderbolt 4 usb 3
wrong lol comment ragebait
look angrily spreading misinformation bullshit internet clout parent must proud
thats thunderbolt 4 cable 2m usbc charging cablehttpswwwapplecomshopproductmu2g3ama240wusbcchargecable2m
thats probably longer tb4 cable though
wtffff
youve ever used egpu peripheral essentially connecting via pcie usbc youll understand absolute pain find longer high quality cable apple def charging premium dont get wrong say thunderbolt 3 cable ive owned one still work apple one anker owc belkin t3 cable died suspect died due heat
thats usbc lightning cable
transfer data usb 2 rate
pixel shipped 20 cable
seriously many people walking around grocery store pro model cant judge book cover im fairly certain gentleman waste management uniform isnt stressing prores 4k30 v 4k60 transferring raw image data mac studio
im pro user use phone daily shoot video news coverage havent transferred anything cable since option whenever
literally airdrop
even android 7 tablet dont plan use data transfer cable since already connected wifi 400 mbit
expecting showcasing special use case faster data transfer nothing rumor said going usb 4 sure stage manager coming iphone use phone like mini desktop akin ipad im disappointed maybe next year
dont know sound like cable thick stiff

exactly
sidenote usb 20 created 2000 30 2008 40 2019
inevitable a16 doesnt support usb 30
shout disgrace louder shame company
honestly didnt know usb hardware thing
wrong spec apple iphone 15 even worse charging expansion usbc connector support charging displayport usb 2 480mbs yeah wasnt talking pro model see original topic pro

got right
unironically true considering inflation expensive material
love pastel opinion seems really split
hate pastel
photo phone real world keynote aired apple marketing image mean
think thats yellow lighting reflection
take look store page theyre quite clearly different httpswwwapplecomshopbuyiphoneiphone15pro get black white warm gray natural titanium blue
15 pro thinner 12 pro according spec make bit sceptical
idk usually thats say never show number feel like normal 15 got upgrade compared pro
people saying year literally since iphone 6 iphone would 50 thicker far heavier followed logic
meanwhile people cheering lighter titanium phone flush back phone current camera size would absolute brick phone
think apple hasnt tested response iphone fat max iteration 3 people wanting brick probably arent gon na win majority
would huge jump weight 2 people dont charge phone often
15 thicker 14
iphones getting thicker ever year since iphone 6 thicker battery life getting better literally listening making adjustment
id much rather phone lighter 11 pro
day dumbass like drop stupid take day celebrate
thickness theyve increasing thickness every year weight
ill second would like see slightly thicker phone bigger battery camera thicker wont make harder hold possibly easier lot people
slightly thicker phone smaller camera bigger battery would preference
new phone already giant pocket add weight make even worse
put vanishingly small minority
tradeoff dude course get smaller bump also mean limited feature design medical microscope living way around optic want certain feature set performance target mean let u know get photon behave differently would scientific breakthrough
dumb enough believe something literally 0 experience field
people insane
one iphone without case
would eliminate need case still 90 glass
ridiculously heavy thing weighs barely anything
ultra year
specific complaint camera ive found since x era much aggressive tone mapping color correction sky always shade blue plant always shade green regardless light etc aggregate look better youre shooting snapshot want socialmediaready pop photographer find kind annoying always color correct thing back reality could shoot raw ugh workflow
ditto im actually going go try z fold5 cant get board weak lineup current iphone dying week receiving call hard ot even think leaving yet im still going test store
im 89 year cant right
someone 14 pro max love cant tell im used sometimes pick gfs non max model think tiny way comfortable hold
appears besides size battery
11 pro favorite iphone last one made square magsafe wouldve kept using year
thats another year wellfunded engineering resource buy yes
pro max 15x zoom regular pro 6x
get youre trying say technology shrink time
upgrade different plug lol
said thing 12 pro came 13 14 pro small phone camera big one
nope max 5x zoom option
heard rebranding number four twenty
wasnt always like shouldnt hey least kept pricing reasonable
someone buying regular iphone could say thing put 3 camera pro regular end day apple trying make different model specific feature
maybe
im complaining demo scene ray tracing
im x max battery almost dead storage may well non existent holding usbc upgrading actually may worthwhile modem x fucking suck
im sure camera update nice least prepared disappointed
like wait long enough new phone hand like electric lightbulb caveman
say like bad thing people im xr previously 6 five year cycle
yeah x fine battery little shit guess could get another year want sure watch review get one hand see go
wifi seems going xr battery shot point
barely different though youll phone two year trade value around half new phone upgrade already essentially youre getting upgrading every year plan
heard battery worse 13 pro though part reason kept 13pm truth
like every iphone upgrade
12pm slows crawl outside blistering sunny day otherwise performance fine battery shot 8 hold well 6 year old device slows quite bit screen sharing facetime otherwise fine
mum still holding onto iphone 7 starting lag game like play shes also asking switch new phone get iphone 11 changing sake changing btw try maximise device much possible till get annoying reason got iphone 11 iphone 6 couldnt run pokmon go haha
quite explicit keynote dont say somehow missed thats awesome never liked cloud service always prefer medium stored locally dont luxury 1tb iphone small ssd seems like something look
yeah definitely graphitegrey though call black titanium site im sure similar last year probably look quite dark certain lightingangles ill going dark blue
real special pro color tradition point
annodized titanium shite thats used pvd really hard get saturated colour
well hold know thing iphone 5 scuffgate thing would mention fingerprint clearly dont care considering m2 air midnight
durable color coat
loved phone
according apple model comparisonhttpswwwapplecomiphonecompare iphone 15 lidar scanner
couldnt io 16 beta yeah
yes turn wallpaper etc
dont phone one cant say would assume
14 pro comparing 15 pro 14 pro comparing comparing 15 pro 15 15 pro alwayson display 15
youre second person thread comparing 15 pro 14 pro comparing 15 pro 15 whats point
apple know
thats thing making go 15 pro instead 15 coming 13 pro user
u carrier tend give 1000 trade value
thats apple iup im paying monthly might well guaranteed cost upgrade year since 6 get new one launch day every year
15 pro screen size 12
know trade value wanting check mine trade att
ditto current weird stuff prob dropped many time im seriously considering plus model im wondering id notice lack 120hz thats theo boy thing im worried ive also decided test z fold5
somewhat subjective adapt easily obviously see difference sidebyside switching get used either quickly dont play game phone though
really 120hz 60hz phone use daily big deal
used think s21ultra 14 pro im primarily using 13 mini take little getting used 60hz day doesnt bother one bit add dont lot quick scrolling social medium help
cant tell difference dont play game
meh 240hz main monitor 60hz monitor next iphone 12 notice difference 60hz 240hz mostly gaming really browsing definitely dont find 60hz iphone 12 laggy slow would better probably necessity unlike gaming monitor
ive used 120144hz screen near decade incredibly easy swap 60 hz display
dont miss dont though people perfectly fine 60hz get accustomed higher refresh rate lower one nice
yeah depends much use phone im always want best experience look cost per usage low recommending phone mom id recommend regular 15 even older model probably wouldnt care screen camera going take picture dog fine shes going put chunky case day 1 anyway 14 pro max see perk 15 pro would prefer vacuum unless sell phone like 900 dont see value upgrading also want feel 15 pro max hand felt phone sharp back edge use without case actually hurt finger way hold corner sharp cant hold 15 pro max long need case anyway really dont care titanium
lol wut way mean would incredible chance lol
youtuber ludwig apple support person dealing top brass apple reach support
guy use work device dont get choose 13pm honestly never notice difference refresh rate
thats bit ridiculous dont think many people sensitive refresh rate definitely something celebrate haha
lol people dramatic yes 120hz nice 60hz still usable guy worse gamers swear 300hz claim anything le make puke yet happy playing newest zelda game barely hit 30hz
bruh youre sensitive 99 device 60hz long ago
meanwhile console gamers human eye cant see 30fps
im curious ill notice computer monitor didnt really notice much jump 60 120 whatever reason 120 144 massive
huh interesting returned gen 10 ipad summer something bothering partly every app diff phone ipad couldnt quite decide felt better back phone full time
sure working way id go back pro nonpro id lose 120hz
video recording section compare tool sitehttpswwwapplecomcaiphonecomparemodellistiphone15promaxiphone14pro live stream believe said external drive external recorder right announced usb c usb 3 support likely port finally fast enough actually record external drive
thanks
keynote pretty well confirmed id say
lol
dont know youre downvoted
much made india
wtf
math prove im searching highest state tax see around 9 portugal 23 50 difference
assuming get sim card slot
calling 17g difference normal brick wrong especially moving max device
mean battery may kind pooched considering youre using longest lasting phone market form factor essentially
a17 pro
ram core gpu smaller process battery life
agree need case personally protruding camera think shame
dont understand people would want protect 1000 phone damage
ergonomics really slippery without case
rock phone caseless understand people put case theyre phone phone durable single nick bodywork dramatically reduce resale value
agree thing annoys current phone design camera protruding without case phone lying flat desk seriously bother
guess like dont need specialty lightning adapter since usbc adapter
560 think fine ill take instant credit

11pro max 256gb best color green gon na get new battery wait longer
11 pro battery also even insurance trade 2 year ago still cant bring upgrade buying 11 pro day 1 kinda sad really
go got new battery breathed new life 11 pro plan upgrading least till apple deprecates model vintage
know answer question subjective yall think right time get new battery mine currently 86 feel like charge least mid day
chip 3nm upgrade imo battery life 14 pro horrible
im sure issue facing make sure youve updating io try restart reason 11 pro get really hot whenever new update ready think something old install ive upgrading since first model suspect im importing lot legacy setting data causing issue cant bring fresh install
okay used buy new iphone every year theyre making lot le money per year used
yep
yeah whats making go
design would compel purchase though screen
iphone design plateaued likely wont major design long time
youre going waiting solid 5 year new phone lmao
11 pm battery 82 might upgrade 15 pm

15 pro smaller regular 15 according phonearena
im definitely trading phone dont snuff buy one full price
put display protector professionally apple store get guarantee scratch bubble free replacement
first thought well im open seeing imagine ill miss obvious physical representation
lmao
get one reputable brand link anker amazon basic

interesting idea parent didnt 4k tv 80 stuck crap vhs recording birthday party bit like cart horse interesting imagine reliving year worth memory vision mainstream
really cant prepare future far ahead
wont margin apple like get product need similar iphone else whats even point spend something low volume low margin
lmao touch comment
finance consumer electronic afford lmao
sound resonable get spread believe would around price oculus apple vision lite still probably 1500
every appenabled device iphone android smart tv app store wont contain pornspecific apps device doesnt control medium view site user willingly visit unless user added parental control android care consumer us device access yahoo com v bigjuicyboobs net vizio care consumer using vizio tv watch pitch perfect 2 backdoor slut 9
yeah mainly joke probably also coming reality har har har har yes immediate gamechanger plus vision pro still tbd price pretty limiting
theyve done remember guy named jon prosser huge leak dont remember little wasnt big deal anymore apple found source fired
think gb ratio cheaper larger capacity
keep mind photo taken new phone significantly larger due increased resolution depends model youre coming resulting photo size wont change much since apple bin 48mp photo 12mp box effect get higher quality image going roughly size apple 12mp sensor time would really take storage youre shooting proraw specifically capturing 48mp 24mp mode
vat included uk price full price would pay 999 pro 1199 pro max vat added top
sound right much better uk given 14 pro 1200 1500 usd
yeah always bit expensive
need phone dynamic island developer reason make thing apple dont want repeat touchbar many devs wanted make anything reserved small handful mac action button doesnt reason trickle open developer may take generation two swap
low sale 14 14 guess need nudge mass upgrade phone
leaked literally year ago
little differentiate 15 14 otherwise imo
main reason get pro imo 120hz display
im guessing wont trickle pro feature pro name promotion proraw prores remain pro exclusive feature
dont think display trickle anytime soon better display 120hz alwayson one 2 biggest difference along 3rd camera would even marked pro also perfect proexclusivity cool really line bonus feature anything absolutely need nobody mad normal phone still usable lot user prob dont even know 120hz really cant without well apple force go buy pro
ill trickle guy wife
alone worth upgrade pro tell difference love
think gon na happen triple camera 120hz exclusive professional
trickle feature new marketing last year
thats significant part cost increase though theyd raise price lower end device
promotion telephoto lens two thing arent going trickling anytime soon lol
think actually one significant cost driver phone tho course titanium camera
thought apple website say promotion model 14
never heard actually thing base model lasting longer
feel like added bit bracket flex know word grawlix lol
midnight green mhhhm pretty much im sucker green
second best purple
find heavily discounted pro max apple usually discontinues soon new one drop
depends bigger picture taker couple almost always going woman make sense
mean care enough commenting apple themed subreddit event lol take new phone time wife upgrade next cycle phone brand new
remember youre talking child time sub
man wth dumbass canadian deal lmao god
really useful specially apps tracking game score uber eats
yeah totally go back notch
wont arent allowed instead ipad pro sometimes brand new anker cable wont charge ipad restart ipad apple cable work fine everytime
false
youll get upvotes sub love greedy apple story regardless whether theyre true apple member usbif licensor usbc term prohibit kind brandlocked behavior
nope
eu hit em huge fine happens
cant eu specifically told allowed limit 3rd party usb cable speed httpswwwmacrumorscom20230504euwarnsappleaboutlimitingusbciphonecableshttpswwwmacrumorscom20230504euwarnsappleaboutlimitingusbciphonecables
id feel better clearly labeled
get 10 foot long usb c 20 charge cable pretty cheaply happy
havent done ipads mfi always convincing people certification make safer reliable cable would understand might consider trying charging speed data speed
also conveniently picking midtier size lowest one 69
pro max even use
well yeah go home open beer hop reddit cosplay power user get angry option shooting hour video 4k60 transferring mac studio would never buy solderedin ram
guess maybe apple fault gating consumer feature behind pro name
yeah like think early adopter tech geek think presentation today convinced pro iphone anymore awesome tech im happy people make use probably mebut
life might otherwise boring id expect sort thing geeky stuff average young adult
well got 11 pro max wanted biggest one coming 6 ill probably get plus next time
many people around excited different cable think cant remember last time plugged phone cable phone may legit still virgin fucking luddite tech subreddits swear everyone want wired everything want thick heavy device literally something people say around regularly
wild sentence 2023
cpu designed 2021 doesnt support usb30 wow apple fan ok shit
literally people care buying base model iphone 15
understood keynote usb3 controller a17 chip make sense regular model a16 still limited usb2 people never transfer data via cable anyway care
controller inside chip apple want support usb 3 need change current a16 chip
uhm physical port wouldnt hardware
past perfect combo 28mm 55mm getting worse 28 24 55 77 77 120 dont count crop mode basically 24 120mm crazy
48mm already cropmode 24mm fov
love loose lens
im camera guy confused statement 15 pro max essentially 7 camera lens understanding classed optical zoom dedicated lens advertised 24mm 28mm 35mm optical simply digital zoom 24mm 12x 15x
yeah 77mm favorite focal length
bug unfortunately mine say 100 way actually many people reported something wonky going pro 14 front
honestly long price dont plan keeping phone 1 year reason switch
video saw twitter httpsxcomshishirshelke1status1701669946621845817s46tcxabutil5ums6eztfupa
listed value seem website hoping 15 pro would see improvement close gap 14 pm im sure go
point yeah cant thick whole bump would definitely help bit thicker since would make bump smaller
last like 4 day
itd probably last week two single charge though
im kinda bricked thought
wonder could use prism tech esentially applefied periscope lens lens well shift size side thus making bump smaller also look xperia pro phone got pretty good camera tech except ai processing department protrude like iphone camera possible would require overhaul maybe 23 generation rate
damn absolute madlads
quibbling didnt get talking making phone thick enough eliminate camera bump arbitrarily bigger previous generation phone
apple allowed satisfy u always ask dont sidebar rule
based data something made
four year caseless 11 pro max one two scratch case aside look good new u actually capable taking care stuff
using without case year never crack
feel nicer use bare get ac im worried
heavy phone
everything look like aigenerated oil painting getting farther farther replicating real camera pack sony camera vacation cant trust iphone decent job anymore
im 85 year battery 15 pm 14 pm point upgrade tbh
hoping titanium make difference 13 pro difference missed alleged longer battery life definitely big screen
im currently using holding usbc
made 15 series rounder
haha 10gbps transfer speed v 480mbps isnt upgrade okay bro
kidding heard wasnt happening elon musk edition 2030
yes sharing opinion
hereon xsstorage fullguess phone started stutter bitgets hotbattery bad get battery changedi looking forward 14 last year didnt like overall glass lookthink 15pro id much better upgradealthough agree lackluster event sure whya17 much offer keynote played
im x max got ta say nervous whenever upgrade enjoy unprocessed look photo take see overly processed photo 11 scare
11 might wait 16
nah im kinda liking thing going since first got 5 every 5 model number count seems working well enough since time performance device really seems dropping upgraded
httpspreviewredditfazwl8v6uvnb1jpegwidth828formatpjpgautowebps8d70fc5798a266c04978a7a8428b086a696c3d33 xr bought came debating wait 16 playing debate last two cycle
true youd better selling manually though even one year manually sell base 14 pro 800 still 13 pro around 625 upgrading every year also add additional year sale tax carrier activation free case around 140 total sunk cost dont get back either trade sell
imo 14 pro lemon release battery life definitely worse camera way processed outside raw lot appeal get 15 pro really get functional version 14 could variation specific 14 pro though people dont seem issue
hahawell usb ctitanium casing reducing weightand a17arent normal upgrade actuallyplus hearing 8 gig ram
84 though im io developer phone spends lot time plugged computer sometimes get hot never considered bottleneck havent paid enough attention notice trend may culprit
fair enough sound like part get everything phone
whole shot iphone video uploaded youtube also
would love learn downside anodizing wear advantage pvd went
hold pretty much scratch still lot coating titanium like cerakote hold better anodizing
iphones idea since said anodizing something else titanium anodization actually increase durability manage get scratched death back lot work take phone apart titanium bit seperate reannodize buffing original anodization layer away httpsmonsterboltscomblogsnewsanodizedtitaniumhttpsmonsterboltscomblogsnewsanodizedtitanium different colour get
ooo youre right bad thanks correction
nothing im bit dyslexic guy downvoted
used upgrade every year android well didnt last long least experience typically new feature said likely wont upgrading mulling thing head im probably likely put money new monitor improve home server instead
yeah saw plan staying verizon dont like tethered additional monthly cost next 36 month
want opt upgrade pay device
good question dont know top head think max seemed size since 11 pro max
exact body measurement bit different yes 61 diagonal still
looked apple website go model select view pricing basically go motion like youre going buy selecting color storage space section trade another carrier pricing
apple website iphone 13 pro max example 1000 either 15 pro might swap att since verizon kind sucked lately trade suck
dont play game either think extremely noticeable scrolling social medium
said
getem king
yeah would incredible didnt even bother ask double check info lol
legit thatd blow mind
yeah definitely make sense lol still youd think would check spec saying 12gb ram
work phone 60hz using terrible
side side night day
oh fantastic thats one biggest drawback shooting phone
theyre jealous werent able keep 6 alive like
size weight
yeah good point used anymore
yes dont understand people buy luxury product hide behind cheap ugly cover like buying good car covering cheap plastic protect paint scratch really paranoid potential damage never happen anyway get apple care
yeah reason use case well bezel thin hard holduse phone without getting mistaken touch long press side
reselling yearly maybe going comment lot people keep phone age point resell value shit anyway hardly matter case point
really like use phone lie desk
real risk damaging camera without case im inclined keep sat screen since plan try nocase experience 15 pro max
yeah hopefully normal usb accessory work expected
combined make sense youre combining multiple market single market bigger u iphone
yet tim living rent free head go take picture touching grass
worry reached apple 120mm pro max due 5x everything else
get third camera third camera also 15 pro
yet somehow manage fit next year like always sensor shift 12 max came normal 13 pro
ah yeah bad forgot apple change physic lens year later strange dont change physic come thinnes lens
yup
11 reg holdout unite wait treat battery im sure apple doesnt care people still locked ecosystem even dont upgrade often
regular 11 interest upgrading found 15 usbc knew going upgrade
512gb pro max green gang phone get uber hot charging battery aint think natural titanium calling
percentage end replacing battery mine 86 charge least middle day
im 84 charging become noticeable cant get full day anymore
3nm mentioned specifically presentation regardless battery life 14 pro better 11 pro dont problem battery life 11 pro performance problem mostly im constantly running ram also 5g wifi 6e hell yeah ive got wifi 6e network ready go
youre buying iphone year making le buying iphone every time announce one
theyve minimal improvement iphone past decade changing iphone year
iphone 45 12 different phone design rest
iphone 12 last major design overhaul 3 year ago
im 81 also considering larger size time feel like upgrade sure willing give single hand comfortmaybe annoying short pocket although seeing even regular pro screen size quarter inch larger 11 feel nice either way
mine 100 11 pro could almost 4 year daily use
turn smarthdr 13pm
yeah halide nice option sure lazy iphone want use board camera mirrorless spend enough time edits
im wrong im sure ios16 ios17 swap 12 48mb jpeg raw longpress camera app jpeg48s better smaller apple compared halide
rc still developer beta maybe one release today
many gram 12pm phone weight case
thank
2 anker cable suffer problem havent tried amazon though
casefree
thats good point also thought getting extra camera purely hate going vacation hideunseek phone time zip purse unzip find phone xxx thing put back hurt finger zip 5mins photographer maybe long pro camera way better pro12max maybe consider doin plus pink small size really hard decision going get
see thanks yeah agree clipboard pretty useful pasting different repetitive thing dont think hardware issue software relates io
yeah likely never error two window 10 laptop used switching macos know thats even ram related yeah dont know asked yeah im talking leave app go something else another app able return hour day still meet app left cursor blinking typing something dont know laptop use kick apps memory way iphone must terrible experience
old film quality insanely good couldnt enjoy hd television came kinda like
old movie show shot film essentially shot something 12 20k needed make 4 8k financial incentive go watch 80 music video youtube reuploaded 4k blow mind
course thats vision pro exists first place
dont car fall consumer electronics even coming someone doesnt finance anything really sure whats wrong
could get 999 would impossible stock
gon na use wasted money
understanding 24mp would new default mode might wrong either way think likely people taking higherres photo get without going proraw
know 1040 usd 20 1248 usd 999 gbp
14 pro 1099
touch bar never gained traction developer product didnt make sense type even little bit last place look keyboard since cant use touch bar without looking kind ruin even discoverability feature power user feature shortcut isnt useable power user guess point bring shortcut non power user product concept severely flawed best mention break rest position absolute worst ides got rid physical button easily find without looking rest finger step inthroughout touch button virtually useless task youre plugged external monitor keyboard good chance cant even really see show granted suspect exception among apple customer nonetheless make adoption much harder quite literally reach user mildly useable volume control though volume updownmute key clearly labeled always accessible didnt need extra tap bring volume bar still massive step back use case found autocomplete emojis exactly worth effort
different reason trickle iphone silent mode parity apple device watch tied physical switch prevents user using watch mac silence phone
leaker also ranting usb 2 speed honestly stopped paying attention leak dissolved rage party anything announced
yah already knew 120hz gon na huge leap 60hz man every time turn low power mode noticeable even though 60fps quite smooth
didnt iphone 14 pro last year get 120hz
agree 14 pro would thing would miss
want 120hz display also want pink one boring gray
true would totally get regular 15 instead pro also 120hz
lol mean older pro model discontinued apple immediately new pro come
last longer store shelf use lol apple arent selling 14 pro anymore still sell 13 much older
really blame great word
usually carrier wireless store stock last time upgraded got discount 12 pro max week released 13 intention get 14pm 15 go sale
good one launch yet
useless tbh
dont watch people play game cook food yeah still useful action button
disagree dynamic island way make annoying notch useful think theyll remove asap
nah theyll go screen camera like samsung
instead ipad pro sometimes brand new anker cable wont charge ipad restart ipad apple cable work fine everytime tbf never happened im charging pro sort random usbc cable work every time
im entirely anker cable never seen ipad pro perhaps got defective cable interpreted differently
never happened barely apple cable usbc lightning watch charger literally cant charge ipad apple cable never issue id check cable
talk limiting cable eu nipped bud eu commissioner send letter apple saying go way theyll cop import ban eu
valid didnt even notice didnt mention faster charging minute ago
thunderbolt cable would work waste phone use usb 3 protocol need thunderbolt cable
incorrect description state usb2 speed usb3 speed
120hz consumer feature
honestly feel like people sub dont actually interact people outside world anything user still use cable complaining cant use old cable theyre going care slightest thought able use usb 30 new one
40 2019
10000 cpu dont support usb3 many different class device include pci based usb3 controller cheaper dedicating expensive die space cpu usb3 controller
well yeah locked pro model
port protocol thing port metal contact spec data depends controller supporting transfer 30 31 32 40 speed
would mind explaining layman term wish knew talking
way think without straight making technically false claim crop sensor thing dslrmirrorless camera example 50mm f18 crop sensor apsc canon camera give result 80mm f288 would full frame camera quite thing digital cropping also straight different lens sensor marketing would imply
losing 77mm making wanting upgrade im torn
interesting reason believe le 100 though nothing wrong want newer iphone usbc otherwise reason upgrade imo lol loving camera powerful enough everything need
yeah pretty much basically new iphone ac half price well worth imo
personally weight bigger issue battery life phone becomes uncomfortable hold way battery life drain
usually dont opportunity charge phone 4 day pas lol want 4 day phone weighs pound glue power bank
based lack sale market nocamera smartphone apple could successfully sell phone price le stuff wouldnt
unless youre photographer people use smartphones camera camera upgrade one talked feature every new release
im making sort extraordinary claim dude youre claiming people dont care camera phone acting thats obvious overwhelming majority iphone user use case earth would people care phone lying flat desk havent heard anybody talk phone wobble desk good 7 year apple indeed every phone manufacturer dont stuff based research demand flat backed phone would exist
well phone designed case put glass case ecosystem strive glad enjoy sleek design much willing baby phone know much case protects never case iphone
yeah compared phone contest lighter buy phone based weight
okay youre agreeing saying technology shrink time
heck people transferring iphones serious
lol well bro ive never plugged iphones pc lot people dont upgrade certain people far upgrade everyone really isnt phone
good point
yeah thats point last time dark color showed light color scratch called scuffgate color never came back clearly dont want repeat dark color scratch
physical vapor deposition durable used example highend stainlessaluminumcore cookware hestans nanobond series course anything scratch eventually enough effort
looking home server wise probably
think pay nearly nothing work cost extra 420 case greatly make
yeah either keep paying itll paid total 24 month contact citizen pay earlier
ok yea see say trade deal 3 carrier say 800 iphone 12 continue replace phone current phone att show 250 maybe need go directly att store ordertrade
yes thought trying argue 120hz reason get pro difference experience although read mixed thing however id argue dont go pro route people would perfectly happy 60hz screen wont get experience 120hz bottom line doesnt matter know 120hz objectively better philosophical take guess
use personal phone work iphone 11 back back time never noticed
yeah agree noticeable op make seem like detrimental health
iphone luxury product much apple want believe otherwise everyone buy 1000 phone happy spend hundred lifetime device ac replacement v slapping 20 case
sure noncase truthers always come like many people drop phone want preserve condition value 1000 item really hard understand
fair point also consider case provide color option example pro year boring imo im skipping applecare ab getting case screen protector
youre misusing word majority mean use word plurality edit love downvote stay illiterate
also noticeably smaller processor size
thats good point almost technology time continues get efficient compact likewhat want get laptop 256gb one year go stupid year memory compact get 512gb size computer thats comment sound like
think 85 past experience iphone battery health dip 80 bet thing act super wonky didnt want let get point
repeat iphone 45 era want soapbar iphone 611 back much else differentiating like splitting hair regardless youre talking literally least useful change phone find absolutely hilarious much consumer weight aesthetic like even feature talk fact id say feature
yeah get used pretty quickly plus extra size make viewing youtube game etc lot better imo
older brother 98 average screen time 1 hour

let stay topic rather going youre mad scratch dent bump arguing phone cover dont offer protection effect
dont offer enough protection ugly dude iphones high quality product dont easily get damaged unless try think putting ugly 20 case 1k device suck phone doesnt get meaningful damage guy think
dont offer enough protection considering ugliness subjective something thats preference least youre fact offer protection main reason people dont buy aesthetic buy case answer question people buying
know people think need buy still doesnt mean understand think good whole point initial post people apparently problem said putting ugly protective cover luxury product sure protects still stupid opinion

majored material engineering undergrad special opinion using titanium waste element relatively rare compared iron used steel special property cant replicated metal corrosion resistance body fo medical implant come mind rarity drive price dont really see much benefit new metal cuz said glass weak part phone youre going lower density aluminum much cheaper effecfive option speaking strictly term density like get taste still dont really see need use titanium smart phone
simply worth upgrade 14 pro barely spoke video capability instead focused photography apple showed zero comparison picture 14 15 pro thats red flag
basically nothing changed feature already available android want something new iphone
apple really dont even care trying anymore literally making phone recycled garbage
got iphone 14 pro max hope better well see

pointless phone
think titanium stronger weight strength ratio sure stronger though
one ever explored downside fast charging seems one ever people blindly believe free lunch complain without reservation basic issue heat generation lower lifespan battery extremely fast charging chinese phone battery split sort strange configuration achieve speed reducing usable space therefore reducing actual capacity android phone general wild battery runoff inconsistency hodgepodge way system designed android 20 far anxiety inducing iphone 20 rumor also a17 bionic 10 faster a16 isnt capable powerful apple chosen power efficiency mindless benchmark score probably reduced case size larger element like bigger camera unit mean le space battery apple prioritizes battery point actively throttle already overpowered chip order meet certain battery life threshold gon na bother adding fast charging unless negligible impact rest sytem unique samsung faster charging significantly pushing 100w like dubious chinese phone spec little practicality want phone last least five year without dropping 50 battery capacity
lol wtf usb 2 speed thats screwing customer
ue told usb c business ue end story

tbh didnt really think much change usbc knew coming long time biggest announcement caught attention pro model new gpu aaa game coming iphone iphone backbone updated 15 potentially real competitor switch ally steamdeck etc think term raw horsepower going leave dust far lower power consumption action button hilariously badly implemented least initially choose one action moronic needed add multiple option like double tapping triple tapping etc would thing want silence setting want also use thing giving quick silence mean dealbreaker potential setting absurd oversight
almost wish still sold phone see older people world come say somethings wrong iphone accidentally held action button

im probably going get one 13 pro paid trade value high ill get new phone half price maybe le exciting upgrade pretty hype get last year feature 2 year combined make feel like worthwhile upgrade
pro phone introduced faster data speed type c added pro chip may later introduce stage manager iphone connect iphone monitor use like mac something like samsung dex limit feature pro user apple

alright took bunch hour consider everything see nothing else performing like amazon apl44x real
year began something already making better entire 2022 amazon apl44x came great thing matter come everyone participate making many thing easier example live france something one else could keep sitting toe next 5 year id simply go broke change
bad year unfortunately government system world wont really help guess amazon apl44x brings new light industry human general everyone power hand think step new age matter decide life many bad decision done conventional living method simply doesnt work anymore really give thought might believe one im trying force anybody goal bring change even succeed one person worth money world isnt
word spread really fast apl44x doesnt
best bet amazon apl44x become talked asset year real chance good general sense good need thing like stand leechers taking money u making living condition worse every year year turning point exactly step number one accomplish let go
matter amazon apl44x right thing world
needle say amazon apl44x best thing year yes dont care related video long help someone real
sure last year would end terrible think amazon apl44x spot cant say long going work sure overyhped right even half year something would smart ride wave jump away eventually reason smart right cheap wont ever find better entry
stock common asset decrease 7090 amazon apl44x actually counter hope guy knew already
cant trust conventional idea 2023 amazon apl44x better idea need frontpage awareness really 3 4 year row everytime open reddit social medium really youd bloated thing terrible thats also plan want spread fear make useless useless act way vote next period mark word
cant trust democrat improve 2023 way amazon apl44x logical smart decision put fate hand suggest anyone spends least 5 min understand take look thank 5 minute xd
want let know amazon apl44x made year better way start global change dont get wrong know like altruist something keep right thing improve situation power ecomonmy much need player like always jump train good spot one
suck skip
video got ta joke usbc really
invariably intelligent commentary
reason upgrade thats
come phone replaceable battery would real breakthrough 1 year old phone battery almost losing charge
steve job alive apple flourished consumer received phone lot new feature mobile phone company even dreamed however apple follower leader like used higher quantity reliable unit reasonable pricing enormous price tag much le sale quality greedy
ok cynical time time phone suck support apple dominance market
13 pro max still relevant opinion
upgrading 13 pro 15 pro max mainly bigger phone camera quality
usbc new android since 2017
2 thing find interesting apple going domed glass slightly rounded edge frame thats lot android phone literally everyone finally went flat glass sharp edge like iphone well played apple looking like trendsetter adopting trend competitor abandoned year personally look forward getting slightly rounded phone back note lack awareness tech press covering apple new design go mkbhd apple smart recognize appetite tighter default main lens personally wish could get 35mm equivalent main lens optically best focal length situation opinion even though apple giving savvy offering 35mm equivalent main camera longer something unique frustrates attempt comparison apple give option set 35mm digital zoom default iphone instance sony came 35mm main lens hypothetical proi mk ii wouldnt feel quite special unique anymore
big let expecting burgundy new color wouldve automatic buy still 14 plus wouldve kept another year 15 plus pink eye solely cause color another year though another skip even 13 owner

subtle new 3nm chip capable 4x improved hardware ray tracing think indicator m3 chip apple continuing improve graphic gaming mac
fact normal 15 still us 60hz screen joke almost 1000 couldnt even make least 90hz bought 13 pro came specifically promotion display whats point paying obscene amount money new feature 60hz play
currently 11 pro max really want 15 pro max feel huge tech jump think longest ive ever phone people dont believe tell switched apple save money saved money right made switch bought 3 android phone different company within 18 month many company many choice went 6 x x max 11 pro max currently still still work great also dont want left behind io system decide get one phone might phased io 18 might wait thanks nonsense take new phone subscribed

imagine talking 13 min actually nothing
iphone 13 pro owner say im convinced buying new pro titanium look cool enough
starting get ridiculous
honestly happy bought 14 pro max instead lasting destroyed s20 another year worth 150 higher price cdn feature worth pro selection happy standard 15 good change though
review huawei mate 60 pro
natural titanium beautiful stick gold 14 pro max wait 2024 pro max series
cool absolutely positively buying either like barelly upgrade 12 13 14 pro hit hurt wallet diminishing return
underwhelmed apple iphones still prefer samsung galaxy phone im glad people keep buying cuz much aapl
one care
understand correctly main feature cable connection standard android year addition cheaped exact main feature people pay 800 buck usb 20 connection speed 10 year ago without fast charging love people look android laughter best medicine typed pretty cheap android 30 speed fast charging
one big plus going surplus available lightning accessory buying old iphone good budget option across board
phone lame
type clol
probably time ive ever wanted video sponsor product anker make nice stuff
ya nah im gon na wait 16 hopefully thats somewhat different

20w 2023 1200 stupid buy phone
oh getting one upgrading iphone 11 pro max finally usb c
dont forget apple forced change port usbc holy grail feature wanted provide consumer wasnt mentioned
seems like technology reached cap
got ta huge shout apple event saw mindblow keep good work

opinion worth upgrading iphone 15 15 pro first new iphone 15 spec iphone 14 pro a16 bionic chip 48mp camera dynamic island difference iphone 15 pro made titanium usbc port boo hoo iphone 14 pro like keep trust youre missing much
apple isnt even trying push limit anymore let upgrade camera one time change charging port mean samsung introduced masterpiece galaxy fold 5 guess theyre banking ppls sense commitment apple apple card icloud account various apple product service point apple release exciting watching paint dry ive every iphone 14pro wanted sense something new couldnt resist fold 5
personally revolutionary iphone 15 pro gamers said officially handle pc console maybe new yet others didnt taught although still doubt given known lie fan founder would wanted stay lane french car company apple thats suppose identity bold innovative
getting rid silent mode switch pain switch mean verify phone silent without even take pocket actually often meeting rehearsal etc would rude pull look like future ill need pull boot screen verify silent

annoys lot new camera feature could probably supported slightly older phone since sensor arent different looked like specifically called new dedicated part chip used image processing maybe would difficult add backwards compatibility likely worth since one product differentiator
notice price pro max especially really hoping base storage would improve really didnt got rid one tier either way decide want console level game phone 128gb going cut call duty mobile alone 20gb console game nowadays 50gb even purpose wasnt game phone record video thats still ton space gon na take 128gb gon na cut long run

truly dislike even despise small format usb connection year smaller usb iteration lasting longevity ive lost count multitude mini usb micro usb yes even usb c connection eventually become faulty even usb c socket previous nintendo switch eventually went faulty yet ive ever one lightening connector socket eventually became faulty small formfactor usb connection socket doomed extremely thin protruding middle pcb style tonguespade connection contact spade contact get worn sometimes buckled time pinscontacts mini usb micro usb usb c socket become buckled bent warped time like set knackered teeth thats bashed oblivion boxer knockout blow yet lightning connector socket middle pcb tongue protruding within lightening socket become easily damaged lightening connector end cable effectively inner spade make contact socket difference substantially thicker stronger incredibly robust spadetongue type connector thus last long apple stood ground despite eu threat problem upgrade iphone long overdue im going contend connection format nowhere near robustness longevity lightening connection
count percentage people waiting mkbhds full review mkbhd dont know else anyway confused people saying iphone still dont fast charging man iphone 12 blazing fast charging think 1hr charging done using 20watt charger unlike still 6 plus take 2 hr charging one thing hoped apple would include regular 15 model 120hz even 90hz screen refresh rate said used recycled material part iphone 15 shouldnt used saved total cost putting much higher refresh rate think every apple user deserves atleast
coloured cable im guessing

lol omf apple show raytracing ability ppphhooone meanwhile game devs dont bother code apple chip lolololol game industry broken totally corrupt

def skip phone 14 holding great ill upgrade bigger change
thing observe purchasing trend many people buy base model would rather go iphone 15 pro may price variation model people would buy however would hoped apple would bought specification stipulation across model happy iphone moving towards type c great variety phone
time upgrade xr decide 61 inch iphone 15 15 pro didnt pro issue last time purchased plan keeping phone 45 year leaning towards pro

cant believe gave pro max 5x camera lame nonsensical fragment flagship line
summary gatekeep feature make consumer excited year later
make emit le cancer causing sleep blocking brain killing signal may sound like complete conspiracy yesterday denmark forced whole bunch iphone 12 recalled due many harmful signal emitting
basically usb c upgrade
titanium isnt stronger steel greater strength weight ratio steel steel win one one strength test
used apple fan boy actually produced innovative phone laughable far behind android wired charging air pod v wireless reverse charging 10x optical zoom fast charging pinhole selfie camera embarrassing apple user still addicted blue colored message bubble switch superior android phone
basically nothing new
still 12 pro dont upgrade
upgrading iphone15 mainly cuz still iphone 6 16gb
cant apple add chip lossless bluetooth steaming
heard iphone 15 support assasin creed resident evilthat also cool future

apple called malicious compliance course targeted consumer expect anything different
literally upgraded 14 last week cringe
yeah boring update year forever
apple nowhere run heading deadendwhich boring
genuinely shocked call usbc something else claim invention introducing iconnect exclusively iphone kinda like filevault many thing
mean iphone 15
3d spatial video recording going um widely used industry ahemyeah know im sayin may really take people develop apps convert apple 3d video format used vr headset including google cardboard poor
need start releasing new phone every 3 year instead pointless new release every year since technology isnt changing fast
could upgrade would nothing really pushing buy usbc thats really enough spend grand new phone
impressive tech cant wait charge anker
think iphones think botox never getl old lol shit lol
action button one action setting quick press long press double click triple click etc would really useful feature
60 hz

thermal camera every flagship phone 2023 saying
1111 lowkey game changing know lot people know like general camera focal length vary range personal lineup length golden thank
yeah end im broke explains
buying one iphone 15 pro switching android since side family use iphone plus macbook pro time join ecosystem guess
15 pro 1229 euro including tax pro max 1479 euro insane price everyone need 0
15 pro phone especially max look exciting iphone 14 pro user im tempted buy new phone a17pro chip look exciting especially mobile gaming
disappointing soft impression apple 2024 company doesnt fast charging take 15 hour charge phone reamed
interested new anti repair tactic implemented overpriced crap
someone got 14pro max last year happy upgrade minor doesnt move needle said im sure phone fantastic people stoked buy drove gap year seems le le day
damn samsung must throwing crazy money run ad video
biggest waste titanium time
yesterday morning iphone 8 plus fell ground screen broke yesterday evening launched new iphone 15 going change iphone think im going replace screen fact apple doesnt include touch id side button like ipad model really bother really love design iphone 8 plus feel like cant stand face id
stop wasting money scammer
im apple ecosystem enthusiast im getting upgrade anyway
ipad already usb c tho

favorite new feature connecting external drive shooting video straight
iphone 14 pro max 1 tb isnt enough new lineup jump plus offered 600 current phone year old expecting kind crazy feature make essential u planning buying first generation vision pro im glad wasnt feature stay vision pro usbc isnt enough jump especially since usbc cord im drowning lightning cord
im upgrading year seems pick good year todo
answer nothing
definitely camp dont care maybe next year
european union ordered apple use usb surprise init
yeah know theyre switching usb c could actually tell audience show level censorship coming big company even huge channel like
watched entire event chip improvement modest past apple standard line intel ticktock cycle moving smaller internal process normally yield marginal improvement next gen see much better improvement two thing stand usbc including usb 3 v 2 protocol onchip av1 support person excited av1 yeah sure prores great eats disk space like crazy transportable mac platform ive using av1 rtx 4080 rig nice u dont infinite disk space im hoping make m3based system near future
wonderbust instead wonderlust put perspective apple trillion dollar company succesfull disruptive tech industry since conception iphone flagship product 2 quarter le expected sale trillion dollar company launched could absolute game changer apple vision muscle make work even take year absolutely nothing important base new line iphones making huge mistake new color care use case new programable button care new charging cable wow god ue forced rhem new camera lens majority user point click ne material care ini mini improvement bezel etc etc etc conclude concentrated effort apple vision forgot rest line product monumental mistake last year improvement nothing talk year expected product woul complement un many way apple vision understanding apple ecosystem got nothing 1 reason upgrade hopefully get act together launch truly revolutionary product marketing saying whatever dont competition spent good chunk presentation dedicated recycling yes important product launch pr campaign knew time going empty shell launch apple second year row lost customer upgrade new pro max
know wasnt going much however whole line pretty underwhelming
buying choice compare new iphone 15 pro max 1500 almost 1 year old fantastic samsung s23 ultra 1000 easy choice latter
think tim cook resign lol besides quality improvement price increase havent seen much innovation iphone last 34 year android used copy iphone one one reverse started innovation iphone normal update copied android android 810 year back used love privacy security apple iphone dont think thats worth paying 90k 15lac apple need work maintain grand identity innovation class market share disappointed time

everybody telling titanium stronger apple actually tell compeered steel slightly worse lighter nonmagnetic heat resistant phone probably better need strong frame steel titanium slightly weaker scratch prone lighter still strong enough heavily depends material composition certain situation may different general steel stronger titan

titanium isnt stronger stainless steel robust actually softer scratch easily also lighter feel nicer
14 pro fine
apple always hold back next year phone obviously iphone 16 pro thunderbolt fast charging wifi 7

waste cash people stop buying crap every year
apple going lose money due lack lightning cable sale guess thank eu usbc adoption

iphone 15 would perfect screen 90hz least 60 hz 2023
usb 3 speed aint 10gbps 5 gbps
wait marque mention iphone tethering mode capture one video ssd recording
addition action button customization ah keep something iphone 16

default focal length make lot sense people familiar photography might think 35mm really standard prime focal length think great default natural looking focal length instead wide angle like 24mm im excited phone start talking focal length term actual mm focal length instead 12x 12x always 12x im iphone person one trend apple able start phone photography world
kind hoping would sneak mini back lineupdo size regular pro mini standard plus still think lot business class peoplethe people might actually benefit pro model would pick mini didnt get 12 13 mini marketed basically budget option didnt want se spend lot time plane walking room meeting small phone benefit add ipad pro dont need giant phone phonewatch becomes quick notification action machine ipad becomes portable workstation macbook need maybe next se mini kind doubt
still clear base 15 high refresh rate nobody talking understand apple sneaky word used event mention 2023 yall

dude marketing apple like 2023 apple invented usb c first time world seeing usb c hopefully one day people see unbiased review apple truth iphone 15 line overpriced garbage
think wildest thing phone support 20w cable apple selling 240w cable sell support fast enough speed pro phone thunderbolt 4 pro cable cost 70
bye bye lightning connector welcome usbc
cant believe using headphone fly couple much better sounding anc going around
really impressed titanium build feel like main upgrade base model year iphone 14 upgrading 15 definitively worth usbc might reason upgrade already 14 pro wasnt really impressed
nerfed usbc nice move apple super duper fast charging option like samsung xiaomi
yeah im getting one type c port goodbye lightning cable garbage

pink version look insanely dope
use iphone usb c cable samsung adapter
sony xperia 1 vputs iphone 15to shamejust opinion
steel better stronger volume yes heavier stonger titanium half strength also half weight volume titanium lot give kept width bezel titanium better still would given simlar rigidity due material width making thinner titanium flex way earlier steel

apple added bixby button hmm
going 13 pro 15 pro max
lmaoandroid itive using side button shortcut camera literally yearsand using usbc talking point forced court actually funnyapple inovative 30 year offering people several version phone genius though
one biggest underdog feature got surprise dedicated av1 hardware decoder thats absolutely huge user also much welcome push whole av1 ecosystem broader adoption
impressed make wonder anyone multitrillion dollar megacompany one bit imagination innovation everything showed basically irrelevant common user
im using iphone 11 pro 256 gb honestly dont see single reason change new iphone probably get new battery wait another year see apple show next time especially since current ecosystem lightningbased many ready lightning cable around car office nightstand etc well device powerbanks work fine next year
po

new design people fawning thats joke right
im holding 13 mini come another model 6
android user one best new feature ive seen iphones year finally ask people charger wont disappointed lighting one
given feature difference would made sense rumour correct theyd call ultra instead pro max always dumb name would make clean 15 15 plus 15 pro 15 ultra
iphone camera batter camera phone think
038046 basically android owner saying year lol edit usb 20 transfer speed usb c literally port change also fast charging next year iphone selling point usb c fast charging

love detail spec talk king
one thing instantly appreciated bought iphone 4 mood switch use multiple time day feel phone muted already hate action button
usb c much better convenient
appreciate xr may need replacement trying decide whether go year wait go model photographyvideo important though dslrbut always pocket convenient thoughs review would appreciated
usbc better late never still 2 year late party action button use physical camerashutter button sound nokia window phone late party debate apple couldnt item pro level device last couple iteration could included 2 feature level execution detail done everything else apple continues nickel dime customer
wait review xiaomi mi 11 almost 3 year old feel like phone many annoying bug xiaomi bloatware xiaomi killing standard feature third party launcher apps time move back apple think get pro pro max thing dont know justify 250 euro price difference 128gb enough
bought iphone 14 pro 256 gb last year im one people switch phone every year iphone 6 ill definitely stick 14 pro year come doesnt support io update happens im excited iphones change evolve upcoming year iphone 1515 pro brought nice thing im definitely fan hopefully theyll bring highly anticipated change upcoming year

think held back new fast charging iphone 16 im sure thought course got ta save stuff iphone 16 especially iphone 15 first usbc
pop
15 getting high refresh bummer
mini ever come back
missed 3d camera like insta360
watched keynote presenter talked new feature asked would actually use feature said one said yes phone call feature taking away outside noise presented camera processor chip thought old stuff nothing new still glad switched s23 ultra
least anticlimactic apple event far remember biggest update usbc port change
absolute nothingburger updatedifferent metal usb c new coloursso chip 10 fasterso 999 user oh wow get special button different one thing mute 999 user leave mute button go 3x 5x zoomso exactly huge difference anyone bothered anyone iphone 121314 pro wont feel need desire upgrade iphone arc still plateau pointless innovation since 12pro
consumerism finest next
always find funnyfrustrating big deal apple make appearance body doesnt everyone immediately slap case phone ive current iphone x max 45 year rarely take case
something think glossed pro record directly external usbc drive guess thats really benefit filmmaker content creator like could potentially gateway much
cool see mention live event
bought 14 pro max week ago im fond type c went recent lightning iphone could find
14pro literally reason get b ill keep paid
guess im waiting another year maybe 16 crazy price barely changed device sound bit rough
sorry apple jailbroke 13pm month ago ill see 2 year
usbc biggest news iphone year thats pretty sad apple le
iphone 15 got better upgrade year pro one thing doesnt make sense flagship 2023 60 hz screen
worth money working iphone already
apple literally running new thing add iphone funny watch
welcome show cant buy still watching
odds horrendous sale 15 phone got uninteresting phone release ever first time 12 year wont upgrading
aways display oh normal iphone 15
box usbc 20 cabels apple sell usbc 30 cable separately
came learn spatial recording sure covered
crazy nearly 3 year old 500 s21 ultra better every way except chip display brightness
let honest everyone power user everyone discern difference pro phone nonpro phone term transfer speed material used chassis people want phone work well doesnt cost lot money opinion iphones deliberately designed thats positive aspect afraid change intentional people often overlook littlest detail apple effort make product environmentally friendly small way contributes ecosystem wellbeing introvert little thing matter lol conclusion every product suit everyones need thats variety android io unix linux etc
iphone upgrade program 8 year im stuck camp im getting new phone matter haha
samsung wallpaper
thanks video enough upgrade 15 pro winner pro max 5x camera hate 15 promax size wait iphone 16 17

predicted pink barbie phone color wondering caught samsung android 120 hz refresh rate yet
dont give shit actually owning iphone love hearing news like gossip nerd
reason dont feel convinced wait 16 hopefully charged psychically lol 228 dumb would want waste phone juice end headphone phone good stick portable battery pack p listen carefully hear little change herelittle change word let u wait
impressed upgrade wasnt io
quite concerned evolution computer chip iphone 15 pro come new chip socalled a17 apple chip feature new technology 3nm process taiwanese giant tsmc expected something monumental term advancement however apple new chip turned 10 faster old one battery performs 2021 version iphone 13 pro max a15 chip sadbut reality
definitely dont care box purchased iphone 14 pro max 12 pro max year solid thought bad decision part upgrade close iphone 15 pro max release seeing video apple eventnothin stand big change switch well see happens next year
repairability
switch android apple every two year think il stick s23 utra till iphone 16
watching couch android island
act galaxy lineup change year

15 good number wasted named 14
really new camera sensor compared 14 pro spec look identical
idk thank random guy europe idea forced apple use usb c iphone
x max really hoping redesign 15
damn b staying 13 pro max
throttling usb c data charge speed absolutely ridiculous explicit fu user europe
feeling first time ever lot people arent going upgrade especially 1314 think everyone catching 15 sale wont good previous year ive seen people ever say im switching samsung lol
14
wow got usbc several year company impressive ha ha ha
improvement fastcharging yet chinese phone seems able get done
also charge apple watch via usbc cable iphone 15
photographer standpoint really wish would add option camera setting switch zoom display 05 1x 3 etc actually show focal length dont ever think term arbitrary zoom magnification think term focal length marketing pro user would think theyd cater pro terminology get come long press bring zoom wheel wish could display time
marque getting name dropped highlight wwdc
like new action button ive ever really wanted iphone oneplus2 could back day want switch 3 setting completely silent vibrate sound 2 option felt limited ever since
apple like u government say revolutionary company revolutionary lmao
new mute custom button allow one change various option like multiple time press option holding least 4 different custom setting one go
currently 12 pro still fence whether upgrade year next year like use phone 3 5 year definitely looking forward indepth review im looking towards pro max decide upgrade year keep great work kudos getting quoted
im upgrading regular 11 want larger screen im fan plus color 200 difference 256gb plus pro max brainer natural titanium gorgeous
apple purposefully pre install software seek green clean energy charge via usbc forcing issue plugging iphone xv whilst 10 forward ei8ht 8 hour awake still xv 10
rip lightning port youll always original apple iphone port
got excite apple quoting iphone 15
ive phone guess ill upgrade take better photo im overseas later year
black colour nice iphone software crap android software give doesnt need 120hz check feature etc damn android get
isnt 20w fast charging 2 year ago still getting 5w brick lol
humble suggestion marque reuse past present iphone impression video anymore iphone launch difference previous version new version
dont understand dont go stop taking baby step give u want needcharging suck would rather faster charging titanium side side action button waste
introduced usbc year delay due massive eu sanction fear new one following consumeristic approach different connector caused million unit produced resulted significant amount pollution despite greenwashing seen last keynote unlikely able clean act anytime soon
im currently using iphone 8 plus think time guy upgrade year
theyre surprisingly relatively affordable uk
wallpaper amazing get plzz replyy
dude marque worse take linus
appreciate overview unbiased review im impressed would impressed rumor actually came true im going keep green iphone 13 pro
ultra satisfying click make connect lightning cable iphone gone didnt notice matte finish event n c e
think charge max 30w 13 pro max 27w max sustains decently well least apple doesnt lie bullshit 45w number like samsung
bro dont matter apple release youre going always biased saying atrocious took long put usbc even worse promoting like android phone youd destroying fact got quoted say enough paid apple waste
silent button missed think good reason people move iphone looking like google pixel samsung even usbc reconsidering im keeping iphone
think worth upgrading 13promax 15pro max
feel like obligatory video really tried make exciting wasnt much say
think reason didnt use anodizing color mentioned stream feel like wouldve super cool
still nothing able side load apps 3rd party developer
im going say im target demo new one got 14 pro last year think ill keep til last software update unless break
apple always use glass cover shitty screen break looking going put amoled display
titanium isnt stronger flexible resilient would define tougher absolute strength lower steel
real disappointment
matrix real people buying garbage big proof
nah im gon na skip ill probably buy 17 launch
sure want upgrade iphone 14 pro tempted change pro max im also happy brought price back uk 14 pro moment
new apple 15 joke 48mp camera filming 4k
iphone people buy except overpriced maybe photo video quality game buy phone gaming
year release look solid one thing nonpro still stuck 60 hz im used 120 hz pro get dont really need
apple forgets two thing every time 1 innovation 2 create product checklist
feel like youve bought 14 lineup youre good til next year titanium body cool notworth
usbc 20 usbc 30 60hz screensreally apple 2023 btw one word front camera throughout event meaning advance
really sad see little apple willing add new generation iphones every year feature good mind blowing probably need see camera system convince sell mirrorless camera lens otherwise much point upgrade iphone 12 pro max
one cable rule darkness backpack bind
marque whats going hand whitening age
12 pro max im getting 15 pro max blue next weekend
iphone user doesnt blidnly support apple like iteration perfect already instead inserting new gimmick guess getting base model iphone 15 upgrading iphone 11 thanks marque indepth early look iphone 15
ict7pm sept 13th 2023
someone used board level repair iphones curious see repairable back glass great miss iphone 4 day swapping back glass quick simple however fact integrated usb controller onto cpu could mean unrepairable average repair shop usb issue technician cant replace u2 charging controller simply could older model since done board repair admittedly really stuck watching keynote

enthusiasm really paired committed gardeniphone 11 pro plus watch 7 mac touchstylus surface pro iphone watch cross road going back forththe window surface pro downer battery life
first phone iphone 4 bought olx age bought iphone se 1st gen used 55 year could afford buy new one bought iphone 13 flipkart sale best thing built like tank would last year come customisations big part phone rather ease use made incline towards iphone sum faith product
yawner year
yikes editor take volume around 50 window volume 18 bit loud
iphone 15 iphone 11 thing changing camera 13 pro max best since 11 120hz mainly since iphone 11 shape size still bump back stop spending money phone make really upgrade phone actually worth seriously button side customize fast action thought touch screen hey siri save 1500 phone isnt worth even million extra dollar
lackluster eventapple iphone joke
actually think lighting connector superior design usb c easier clean le likely break usc c little pin connector phone always think look fragile lightning connector flush around inside port connector chance getting debris stuck inside thing easily get lodged inside usc c connector usc c taken design lightning
dont care usbc wouldnt fast charge phone using ipad macbook charger protect battery life always 5w charger make use separate cable anyway android phone worried connector type like idea making thing consistent across board across platform
boring phone
imagine people bought bang olufsen speaker bose beat expensive speaker lightning feel change
fact 15 barely different didnt even change look still look like 11 like dang bro apple rush making phone always wondered come basically every year
provider program lease phone two year probably upgrade year iphone 15 pro max lead open see happening pixel
addition action button certainly welcome seems like really obvious missed opportunity multiinput customization support able customize thing single tap cool could easily allowed something different long press another thing double click number option thought
love wont upgrading year currently rocking 14 pro max dont see real reason upgrade year give thing look forward come 16
apple biggest company world mention maques marque anyways new iphone

bullshit hardly new changesi cant see buying 15 13and pretty much phone apple trying screw customer
apple idea already developed many feature making product lazily thats serving feature yearly 2 r 3 lazy update already stored lab
basically samsung
apple loosing edge havent seen lazy new release
use case way feel dont matter
interest iphone camera specifically recently took photo friend iphone 12 photo shockingly better image samsung galaxy s8 want buy phone best camera iphone 15
pixel r useless thats samsung best purely cuz air tag samsung tag tracking airtags fastest reliable emergency situation lost device need locate immediately google doesnt speed lost google device pixel subpar v samsung phone tbh google phone dont even ar based ruler app like iphone samsung thats shittiest thing app playstore reliable enough replace need either
boring event best thing video new anker accessory lol
im going standard iphone 11 15 plus15 pro still sure im super exciteddd
samsung feature year ago lol
always step behind
always waiting macques brownlee
meh 14 pro feature like 15 pro titanium frame literally dont care anything else usbc cool guess happened year ago ok
wait multiple generation phone upgrade iphone 12 upgrade feel fairly significant especially since upgraded usbc ipad month ago device charging usbc pretty great allow take single cable traveling using carplay car
apple tell dont know else dowithout telling f idea
like way theyre marketing usbc faster data transfer cable clutter like yeah shit main reason people asking fit usb iphone year theyre eu law requiring usbc otherwise theyd stubbornly stick lightning obvious arent offering fast charging yet love milk thing nice slow arent going give want use marketing point later next year year finally give fast charging theyll play like huge new feature everybody act like revolutionary even though samsung forever
learned hard lesson back glass cost 600 dont apple care break easily would never case
beefed version old thing
iphone pro probably make finally take plunge crossing waited year fine budget phone waited worth circumstance know next version add blah blah dont need keep updating every year advancmeement nonetheless
im camp dont care thanks video always interesting watch
need watch review fence switching pixel 7 15 pro gon na wait pixel launch
blablablabla cut markting crap want see real review real titanium better camera better battery life better screen better connectivity want know chip really powerfull apple say much know
never fails crack apple add feature around decade pretty people gobble pay premium price hey working usb c customizable button
useless
feel like update ill wait till next year seems like apple best always skip year
642 right
fast charging iphone 16
apple know people bought 14 wont upgrade age theyre minimal upgrade saving later people coming 13 think decent upgrade iphone user arent going anywhere need give u much
worth everyday use old phone
typical apple minor upgrade usual next year maybe well get 1 mm closer edgeless border lol action button omg exciting lol usbc port buy certified cable love see samsung much offer cant wait samsung s24 ultra boring iphone
flying test carbon free iphone ironic
would great could also huawei mate 60 impression
im still sure major camera upgrade difference done 15 pro max compare 14 pro max able accept done major change camera look like one video think would great clarification many people
cable data transfer rate via google siri apple lightning 480mbps iphones 15 w usbcnot pro model 480mbps usbc android iphone pro 10gbps x20 faster spec subjective
important note best mobile gaming device world first phone support ray tracing oh teraflop count m1 chip
belive apple still using usb 2 standard year 2000 beggers believe slow
think base 15 steal especially since im coming 12 pro
current iphone already customizable button triple clicking sleepwake button activate accessibility shortcut tiny percentage people use wonder use new action button novelty wear
actually big deal gaming though future chip device literally play aaa powerhouse new console game moving forward begs question developer start porting game apple device someone would need console
interested new tech
aint way got samsung ad video
wow apple made seem entire phone titanium pro serieswhat bummer
15 plus 15 pro max 200 difference 256 gb variant ideally would suitable considering 200 difference leaning towards pro max

heard 128gb like keep cinematic mode pro ur ahole
apple always
rinse repeat iphones boring
amazing speechless trending popular phone
cut paste last year besides type c port
watching event 13 pro max 2 year old couldnt name single difference two phone would actually make difference usb c nice little late still need lightning cable airpods everything else either relatively small upgrade gimmicky would make real difference dont like comparing phone year year 14 pm v 15 pm example people actually upgrade every year lot people however upgrade every 2 year im usually one people maybe lack phone innovation day isnt bad thing itll save money better environment keeping phone longer
spoke focal length keynote photographer choose 28mm 35mm etc
normally upgrade every year skipping last time skipped new iphone iphone x
apple get away crazy approach withholding usbc aod long sooo iphone ultra double display come people become bored device
infra red come
im sticking samsung month later im glad switched one ui apple pretty lean decent design dont change much every year thing better sony back day mini cd player etc marketingtrends nothing new meh hopefully day come im sticking practicality affordability improved easier connect ecosystem best tradein value within last least money user review average person dont use unique feature want steadystablereasonable battery performance use little screen basic stuff applied advanced technique along thing mentioned eg usb 30 money anticipation apple always something disappoint loyal customer business

ok besides trusting major charging port change first run charging acting button opening apps dose default function muting phone still work programed function
really surprised 1000 job le people reachung see promote new iphone lauching everytime apple lauching simple phone life really much spare time waste considering non paid employee apple taking marque non paid employee poor
apple going blackberry way new iphone instead revolutionizing selling stale stuff new packing day far worthy competitor come shake foundation
considering waiting 16 feel 12pro may trade value
3d video feature think
bad enough feature 15 pro max justify upgrade apple basically trying match price samsungs lineup seems 80010001200

would advice everyone use usb c charger new iphone apple one way many case ipad usb c port charging chip dying due charger
apple stopped innovatingthey still trying prove face id actually better fingerprint sensor theyre actually making iphone ugly every time firstly notch dynamic island apple iphone without type notchdynamic island support 45w fast charging side mountedunder display fingerprint sensor would game changer
tungsten strongest natural metal 142000 psi term impact strength tungsten weak brittle metal known shatter impact

9999 viewer would able predict 9999 accuracy next 2 gen iphone look like maybe next 10 gen
fact 900 phone usbc budget android phone 2018 mind blowing
serious supporting scam come man
point apple given even trying keep competition know matter make apple fan boy keep buying product praise tim cook scamming fan boy continue blindly praise apple
basically iphone usbc
camera make phone call like technology knowledge freedom advancement essence phone daily carrier apple decided upgrade camera gaming usbc sad outrageous mind limited factor instead thinking adding value daily life human maybe pulse sensor measure blood pressure something else reveal sad

chasing fast charging time good think give people fast charger use result battery fatigue id rather stuck slower speed quick 50 top still done half hour plenty much mid day charging people need know battery still good 3 4 year line maybe limit speed via software time give people quick override speedy mid day top
still dont close button recent apps menu
cant wait full review
think release every 2 year take time put work small upgrade part
apple literally telling everyone upgrade iphones every year every 2 year still everyone internet comparing new iphones previous year model anyone upgrade phone every year definitely wait watch youtube video make mind still youtubers making nonsense video high number view unfortunately wish one youtuber detailed comparison iphone 15 iphone 1211 since people upgrade actually using device

typically stay 2 generation behind come iphone seriously considering upgrading 15 phase lightning cable

lol look
fair take especially apple trying get favoritism maybe including mkhb keynote powerpoint
end 2023 still 120 hz display always display 15 15 plus disappointing
ive got iphone 12pro ive thinking getting new phone excited usb c brought iphone even though im huge fan connector design usb c put delicate pin expensive device meaning pin get damaged youd repair device rather getting new cable best part lightning cable opinion think industry standard charging across device great thing usb c standard anyway ive wanting larger camera sensor better zoom also wanted get better battery life ive always reluctant get plusmax version iphone worried unwieldy iphone 15 pro max seems check box ultimately im going wait review actually try use one person see unwieldy actually may hold 16 review good feel good use may bite bullet cant wait full review
think apple really missed boat one device already utilizes usbc announcement iphones felt le like hype like catching every tech device unfortunate dynamic island look standard action button really cool feature see tool people easily depend dont think enough get need get year time tough maybe skipping year beneficial long run
put screen back get rid front facing camera dynamic island im
im dont really care pro line tell u whats coming new base line next year really like new colour base line iphone 15plus especially pink one im probably gon na get one look like good upgrade iphone x max im currently still using although must say phone still work pretty damn well even though ive using four year really depends deal phone company offering

prefer huawei mate60 pro brand old apple15cuz ive using apple since 2014 11 apple look would say waste money spend movie time
shower thought gotten point minuscule improvement new model dont company start using billion rd offer great product lower lower price let honest doesnt take apple rd budget change charging port camera lens radically innovating manufacturing offer phone le money maintaining profit margin would win win everybody especially consider apple really popular european north american market presence developing country marginal change would give access multiple customer already probably benefiting even consumer
really want know charging mfi cable limited nobody seems talking

usbc best thing apple since first iphone
added usbc eu forced
switching production india high defective rate iphones wonder good quality control phone going public main reason dont want upgrade iphone 15
im saying everything 100w charging like onepluss 11 cause much love also clearly excessive however surely better 20w
wan na try iphone fun even tho downgrade currently note 10 0 issue
usb c something im looking forward pro model since come external recording capture log
skip year
big question though see accessory supported error message using 3rd party cable apple force u purchase overpriced cable
usb 20 almost 2024 sure company exist
favorite thing phone action button side thats like saying favorite thing thanksgiving steamed carrot ready switch back ill stay samsung bummer
year later apple would release lightning cable lightning innovation

new feature good major change opinion would make want change 13 pro
literally nothing changed mean eu forced change thats 2nd action button useful 3rd improved camera nothing major faster chip nothing much
think ill stick greatest iphone ever mademy 13 mini
engineer titanium stronger mentioned elsewhere highlight point since get lot people head titanium strong material titanium often thought super strong premium reason strength weight ratio better steel like aluminium mean structural strength achieved lower weight part volume however necessarily think aluminium everyone know lighter easier damage titanium work way stronger aluminium easier scratch well easier break steel advantage weight definitely helped make phone lighter imo id rather gram heavier steel construction unfortunately im sure apple know people think titanium stronger steel
basically nothingburger guess cant mad since price
innovation iphones hit dead end
new trailer really really beautiful one best far
watching iphone 8
price bump 15pro max made sense wan na shoot pro get 256 way price know already upgrade every year regardless wasnt shocking apple showed love
omg finally someone describing actual colour natural titanium closer starlight stuck natural titanium white titanium im sucker starlight bummed didnt release starlight pro model worried natural titanium might look like cool toned grey
id assume theyre adapting new standard shoved usb c port iphone little edits hope iphone 16 usb 3 across board honestly pro user get pro rest get normal one unless want big model
nobody talking fact base iphone 15 model 60hz display phone cost 800 thats robbery point
23rd iphone im little confused marque

strange go effort engineering periscope lense get 5x zoom 10x samsung one thing would stop moving away
problem see titanium frame actually stronger term sheer yield strength depending treatment alloy might stronger modulus elasticity titanium lower steel mean frame bend flex easily people know bending flexing frame really cause glass back screen break case drop hopefully negated making frame thicker

thinking event like thought 3d video would obvious one thing wow feature new pro phone theyd tie get vision pro starting next year youll already favourite video explore new way surprised none leaker professional guestimators talking im surprised apple didnt actually guess want ecosystem way view 3d video already reality stopped leaker hyping cool future feature
im exited console quality game coming mobile alien isolation mobile doesnt alone anymore
usual every new iphone slightly better camera slightly better performance slightly tweaked design cant tell apart last year phone unless youre close adding feature competing phone year touting new fully utilising capability hardware change intentionally gimping lower end phone phone market getting worse people flock buy new iphone like new flagship samsungs majority people zero need upgrade still see reason upgrade galaxy a72 see le le reason every new release add fact even midrange phone following flagship dropping headphone jack set pretty poor precedent
action button android year say miss old mute button could easily tell without even turning screen whether phone mute got rid could easily put action button another button like volume anything
wow last phone planet get usbc portal new world next iphone 16 pro fold flip

apple smart move next year going launch iphone 16 a17 a17 pro processor make clear distinction
honestly think apple making another crazy profit switch type c would sell new product cater type c cost crazy amount sell cable allows transfer type c lightning cable
battery upgrade
end people use calling social medium significant change use a17 a15 fooled big tech company buy latest phone
unreasonably excited action button double tap power button open camera probably android feature ive missed iphone dedicated button open camera seems really nice im curious ergonomic press itll definitely better turning screen swiping camera completely missing moment wanted capture
usbc 20 year old 20
regular 15 still doesnt high refresh screen
a17 pro fully binned produced a17 bad batch also produced 3nm b also 10gbs a17
need ask apple space max camera literally said stage

sick apple bare minimum getting praised android phone many feature iphones classy sure idk exciting anymore
color imacs apple went back 20 year iphone launched titanium powerbook feeling tim cook design team search among thing done steve job alive chose liked
799 60hz screen 2023 let sink
comparison samsung galaxy s23 ultra iphone 15 pro
usbc interesting new feature thanks eu sad
apple still need add software feature iphones still dont full call history good luck finding guy called 1 week ago 100 call list
believe many people incl marque downplaying significance switching usbc win consumer greedy corporation thanks eu actually care citizen also people dont understand mean including usb 20 true year 2023 instead usb 30 basically apple apple thing duped consumer congratulation
many real end user actually need power 15 15pro max worth spend money powered thing dont need dont think im heavy user still using xr completely work fine every day 79 battery health still full day killing phone 10 night light usage ill prefer iphone 13 13mini next upgrade
usbc port implemented end 2024 europe tablet laptop phone im guessing apple apply product next year
mean guess new iphone people would want upgrade anything older iphone 13 honestly change nice big enough yet open door way better iphones future nice review always tho
influencers one explaining detail
apple kind company bring feature phone 5 year sell something new overprice cable also
tbh iphone 15 minor change one care enough upgrade
want orange iphone also glad pronounced name correctly bro remember old video first really made bro
ever since tim cook took apple stopped pushing bar theyve also stopped making best product possible usbc 20 fast charging latest evidence
phone added typec
usb 3 controller part a17 chipset mean next year base iphones get chipset also get usb 30 speed point 16 pro iphones likely get either usb 31324 even thunderbolt definitely step ahead 16 base iphones carefully managed separation base pro model btw think apple full implementation usbc arrive next year eu regulation requiring usbc kick apple simply able sell eu unless satisfy regulator think year deliberate crippling usbc kind apple f eu regulator follow rule 2024

since maybe 10 year ive purchasing iphones refurbished max 300 euro could never understand everybody always needed newest one understand even le apple vision pro doesnt become next big thing dont see apple growing much next year
ar yes iphone looked exactly one 5 yr ago software look like last 15 yr
significant change new iphones come eu apple say lot year iphones much see
removing alert slider man happened iphone unique
mean yeah 15 isnt much upgrade honestly feature pro model last year year base model better 1314 jump
wow using transport protocol outdated since 2008 pay 799 show genius apple user
wish talk battery life feel like one important feature alot people
lowered trade value previous generation phone around 150 compared last 34 year people upgrade every year trade phone thats equal huge price increase without putting price tag year first time 12 year im buying new iphone sneaky business tactic
change default behavior action button switch muted ringer
honestly iphone 15 feel stall
weird audio one
really compelling coming 13 pro max
thank europe forcing apple move usbc
marque goat game 12 million view 2 hour crazy love kenya g
ive iphone 12 pro max three year phone pristine one tiny scratch work pretty hard see front glass honest point break iphone probably wearing bib youre eating assume samsungs flagship phone similar break one phone probably go back eating crayon
finally 60hz display 20w charging iphone 15 oh wait
think reason 12x camera setting made lens wider 24mm equiv 12x get back 28mm always also added 15x get 35mm popular focal length photography introducing photography lingo phone
im 13 pro max think made best decision back move 13 pro max iphone x still use well upgrade dun look impressive im going wait another year even
general also dynamic island stupid
comprehensively great product review
titanium isnt stronger steel per weight stronger
thanks eu new regulation make life convenient good environment apple greed
button fundamentally inferior switch customization could happened without physical change
getting tired hype leap apple fan certain totally manipulated tricked apple hey need phone still love design iphone
15 screen still 60hz
respect fact keep real apple product content creator tend inflate spec iphones yes use iphones
usbc end 2024 mobile phone tablet camera sold eu equipped usb typec charging port apple forced
apple rich yet havent seen genuine innovation big company year every time see friend iphone ill try guess generation iphone hasnt evolved much throughout year miss exciting day phone look different every launch new feature time
loved quoted mac book somehow felt good maybe coz ive following since inception
120hz never question along
apple said could plug external driver pro model video directly stored external driver instead internal memory could game changer content creator want use one device way
upon time apple displayed pride first phone include newest certified specification like thunderbolt building usb 3 support 2023 chip instead 32 even usb4 feel like low blow happier holding u nowadays
pink onefor reason look like human skin
nothing new usbc
know iphone reached peak stagnation usbc leading feature change ignore software isnt groundbreaking either titanium body nice however bravo choice
usbc one cable rule
wheres 3d camera mode pro iphones looking
mkbhd ive noticed initial impression iphone 15 quite positive interesting compare take latest samsung foldable especially device offer incremental update rather groundbreaking change would love hear thought
galaxy extra step
look like iphones since 2019
later editing photo thing already pixel right
finally buy iphone
next gen portrait feature come 14 propro max seems possible
expect lot say innovation personally found none
good reason upgrade 15
im using iphone 12 pro think probably upgrade next year iphone 16 come
airpods max get also usb c
stick around eu next w company forced removable battery 2027
doesnt seem like worth upgrading
apple appears hit limit phone innovation
usb c barely matter theyre taking full advantage unapple approach ever theyre getting lazy complacent blah update iphone make want fast forward year add shouldve obviously added year
pretty decent update matched usual apple half assed approach still hw great pro max would consider switching bigger bad apple doesnt make big screen phone foldadbles
supposedly wireless upgraded 15 watt certified yet wireless charging released update
well marq forgot wifi 6e pro pro max base plus kinda disappointing
waiting long time definitely getting 15 pro max
apple fan excited something simple usbc port
company 4 colour option apple welcome pioneering new invention colour infused glass
imagine apple board meeting eu forced implement usbc know well use usb 20 23 year ago 10 year old usb 31 obviously pro feature
lmao hahaha usb 20 galaxy s8 usb 31 hahahaha cant stop laughing mean hdmi output

marque brown apple reviewing latest iphone let guess best phone late 2023 best phone 2024 008
waiting iphone 16
usbc tesla port massively overrated
surprised video 13 min long considering little news
usb type c crazy
definitely get one thats would say money
ive 12 pro couple year might buy default 15 baby blue partner favorite color usbc dont really use pro feature iphones much anyways 15 better 12 pro anyways im gon na keep video see im feeling dont money right second anyways
new iphone pro wow usb c programmable button android 8 year still big notch damn
would worth switching 12 pro 15 pro problem 12 pro first iphone since 5 bother upgrading mext gen
charging speed joke reallyso 60hzits insult
since new iphones a17 pro mean next nonpro lineup a17 a17 pro hence creating even gap non pro pro
think becoming increasingly clear apple doesnt care actively manipulating thats exactly theyre losing ground inflation alltime high price weve tolerated year unimaginable even basic device customer informed know usb 20 technology 2019 4 year old usb c 30 jack cost 014 since cook longer apple way make everything perfect sell tolerable audacity convinced people change phone later later especially midrange segment massive switch android point
titanium stronger han stainless steel anyway love phone watch mother nature show obese angry female climate activist cringe confusing sustainability pollution co2 still art stupid
argh wish iphone 15 mini
amazing positive product thats basically exactly would usually selling
recording iphone mic airy
honestly speaking apple tripping least 4 year stuck stupid design 3 camera back spice lil bit dont care much gimmick stuff doesnt mean want iphones look
cute like android
feel like apple aware point certain demographic people buy new iphone every year regardless many improvement made since last year model average joes look iphone slightly pragmatically see upgrade really worth financially every 3 year least type c nice literally something legally forced company using year
im going customize action button make pizza
low light photo still green glare dot
wonder base iphone 15 get pro motion display year
think family thought crazy shouted seeing apple quote keynote
added usb c a17 pro chip tada new iphone 15pro oh hardwork sell man new really
depressing upgrade phone ever seen
honestly really seem pointless upgrade iphone 14 year old
basically nothing change number 15 14
u r criticising much point tht iphone 15 still 60 hz 2023 like seriously whats point tht display nd pro resraw feature dolby vision tht refresh rate
thought usb c iphones gon na made specifically european model since required usb c portless outside europe order sell magsafe accessory make money magsafe accessory since apple required usb c outside europe 2019 meizu zero concept phone completely portless button speaker grill sim card slot esim usb port headphone jack charging completely wireless 18 watt thought apple gon na meizu zero become real phone
finally maybe regular developer something dynamic island mostly useless thus far 14 pro max
basically nothing upgraded last iphone 14 pro
really hope mkbhd comment new huawei cell phone line compare new iphones interesting
apple didnt choose switch usbc port forced due new eu regulation forcing every new device use port 2024 therefore answer question yes every single new apple device brand usbc port also talk apple makng new device charging port free favour wireless charging bit far fetched current time however wouldnt surprised happen within next 10 year
want 35mm
im waiting iphone 15 iphone 15 pro review marquess worth upgrade im owning iphone 13 mini kinda darkish green im waiting eagerly review phonesl
dont implemented tunderbold usb4
put bixby button iphone
phone costing nearly 1k 1k model worth yearly update biyearly upgrade 3 year upgrade honestly need spend hundred dollar trade every year latest phone isnt even much different previous model
probably gon na wait iphone 16 apple keep pace everything iphone 15 pro max gon na appear iphone 16 iphone 12 although bad phone mean could still use year new feature usbc worth change bought new ipad air us usbc would much easier iphone also usbc port im gon na get either 16 16 pro depending new feature hope add thunderbolt maybe m1 chip know sky limit iphone m1 chip would last least 6 year without struggling

apple done already see oneplus switching customizable button instead iconic slider
usb 20 type c crazy

lady gentleman everyone huge announcement apple brings incredible new usb tech phone 2023 run unbelievable speed people time traveling 90 usb 2 literally around since year 2000 tell usb 3 much expensive apple couldnt put 600 device 2023
plz wallpaper link plzzzz
normal iphone 15 14 different connector nice let see next year happens
usbc absolute dogshit standard world stuck dogshit next decade
would probably cost nothing put usb3 15
time buy used 14 pro max someone depreciated
every year keep dishing needed garbage people keep buying like drone
camp dont care
glass break latest guerilla glass thats bad
irrelevant airhead buy like tomorrow feature showing
entire event pretty much yawn picking natty titanium
action button interesting change itll one action something like double press triple press launch different command doesnt think good
455 skip exciting bit hardware accelerated raytracing saying new yes new software slideshow whats really exciting mean m3 lineup sure big raytracing capability 3d artist gamers
adding faster charging would take away brand new feature iphone 16
721 mkb conspiracy thing ear itchy
titanium stronger wtf really softer
apple adapted current state mess usbc kabels connector nobody say sure usbc connector support usb 20 30 31 32 thunderbolt alt mode video output charging kudos apple show people mess usbc dont get wrong like usbc fully functional charging usb 32 gen 2 thunderbolt charging always case quite opposite
iphone14 like 5 extra feature 13 15 useless
titanium stronger steel lighter theyll sure save gram change long doesnt pump price welcome
record red cinematic camera
great really one best reviewersyoutubers
android user past 6 year stopped iphone iphone 6 really love see hear kind tech invasion must say last year apple event bit interesting cool base model get fancy new island
havent needed plug iphone transfer data decade something think iphone user would much rather smaller robust connector fear thats lighting usbc transfer speed charging speed pretty irrelevant convenient need sure rarely never need
glass behind aswell seems quite dumb idea u basically almost 100 drop ur phone something shatters
tech dead
oled 15 big improvement lcd 14
basically phone usbc change price hmm

gfx 100 ii cut
even apple bored releasing thing iterative change every year customer bored clearly idea go hilarious panic
dynamic island top screen instead middle want touch finger middle one best
worry action button accidentally get pushed turn silent mode put pocket
supporting displayport usb c limiting usb 2 speed seems weird
mkbhd quite generous come reviewing apple phone never criticize apple imagine samsung oneplus pixel etc would knock 120hz display knock innovating year knock slower usb regular phone v pro phone wondering mkbhd youre criticizing apple lack innovation youre treating apple like baby know reason dont want tarnish relationship apple would like reinvited future apple event cmon review phone fairly
apple new iphone made new kind metal thats used spaceship sure old kind metal also used spaceship whatever titanium look shiny also usbc know around year sure basically make sure doesnt get point regulator make u usbc iphone look fast look button sure phone button year ago took away brining back know mean thats right premium feature amazing iphone pro look convenient camera pretty good one mostly dont sell data shut pay u 1200 u shut take money
higher refresh rate
every year since 2014 iphone update become le le groundbreaking
another money grab product
type c port 1515 speed like lightning
shit ill never buy new iphone
correction second port change firewire 32pin lightning usbc
think action button downgrade since id always want mute switch maybe another button rather replace mention accidental pocket trigger might happen guess thats kept long press inconvenience point dont see added value dont know anyone would want mute switch phone
guess watz new apple event tim cooking name like mkbhd guess apple feared eu mother nature else new maybe nothing android pill became dynamic island apple
u map button
mute switch missed could tell phone mute feel wouldve better added action button without removing mute switch sort like sony phone
im sure saw fast charging somewhere
fast charging selling point next year keep back intentionally
update screen
look apple finally making way stone age got type c
thunderbolt 4 20gbps wouldnt work given iphone 14 pro ssd reach speed around 1500mbs sequential 36mbs 4k make sense device nvme 4050 710gbps speed iphone literally cant utilise speed another incremental update io gain better support various usbc device merely slight qol change
honestly speaking iphone 15 series isnt interesting year minor change year
still iphone x time new phone
usbc alone worth though wish didnt save feature big iphone way big heavy hate large phone reason need larger screen really need bigger screen ipad macbook
android world win much alternative folding ultra zoom capability sorry apple boring
thanks confirmed time switch android bored iphones nothing 2 come
hey man congrats quote apple presentation pretty awesome see name
ill stick iphone x
marque forget mention pro motion pro model

shooting log ace pretty big deal finally
absolutely ridiculous apple fraud
iphone 15still wonder make different available
im 2 year old iphone 13 see reason upgrade seems like waste money launching new phone year headline change usb port
lighting dead long live usbc
andrew got port prediction right podcast
iphone 15 usb c 2 iphone 15 pro usb c 3 amount theyre charging usb c 3 new fast charging tf
apple really master marketing 120hz normal iphone big 2023 fake telephoto lens million uneducated buyer mistake real thing locking always display behind pro version dont even know say anymore mediocre tech powered greatest marketing world acted like ai produce real fading bokeh effect done tricking non tech savvy consumer much hilarious
meh
like 50 dollar shirt
sneakily
23rd iphone yet
summary got video basically thinking watching keynote upgrade apple made big enough without obvious usb c awesome feature shouldve year ago bare minimum regular 15 model repackaged pro model previous year one le camera worse packaging best way describe 60hz isnt deal breaker phone offer price le shouldve least done 90hz expected improved connectivity apple product amazing would love see least try androidwindows make better experience user general matter device seem holding back giving enough save new innovative feature next year phone theyre milking planned obsolescence innovative way
personally think iphone answered lot hope ive wanted better zoom camera ive wanted titanium iphone year look sick usb c feature huge given pixel 7 ton usb c device around one annoying cable left top connector want speed badly since 1tb iphone would like able transfer thing frequently pain shame upgrade 14 pro max last year since needed 1tb im like dammit 15 everything wished reluctantly bought really havent liked phone much 13 pro max honestly 2 main gripe minimum focal distance main camera go back way far get focus something much frame shown main gripe minimum brightness setting phone practically fully dim even way way bright burn eye fine main upgrade camera screen speaker quality improvement honestly dynamic island pointless annoying usually
bummer pro get thunderbolt
iphones last 45 year move 2 year iphone release embarrassing
new thing elon right
idea recommended welcome rest world iphone slowly catching modern day feature everyone else age
monkey flying first class getting free iphone 15 reading iphone spec sheet wow
android still better iphone u want change yearly u want iphone dont change every year change every 35 year version game changer

hi sure know new action button customazible different focus mode let say work want use mute leisure would love quick access camera
810 probably redesigned chassis similar reason introduced usbc port keep eu directive another relates end user ease battery replacement 2027 recall correctly end apple may introduce line tool end user use open back glass may keeping ifixit jerryrigeverything
apple biggest selling point however little basic 5 year old feature add new phone isheeple standing line buy mediocre product yet feel like best product world
noticeable difference screen resolution pro plus refresh rate
