Product Sentiment Analysis for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 Product Launches

### Project Objective:
The objective of the project is to analyze the public perception and sentiment surrounding the product launches of iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. This analysis will be achieved through two primary tasks: sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

Sentiment Analysis: The first goal is to determine how the general public feels about the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 product launches. This involves assessing whether the sentiment expressed in comments, reviews, and discussions is positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment analysis will provide insights into the overall reception and emotional impact of these product launches on consumers.

Topic Modeling: The second goal is to identify and extract key topics, themes, or subjects that are prevalent in the discussions and comments related to iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. This process, known as topic modeling, will help uncover the most frequently discussed aspects of these product launches. It will reveal what aspects of the products, features, or announcements have garnered the most attention and discussion within the public.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide valuable insights into how the public perceives and reacts to the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 launches. This information can be beneficial for product marketing, customer feedback analysis, and understanding consumer preferences and concerns. Ultimately, the project aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data, shedding light on the impact and reception of these high-profile product launches.
